{"text": "on the twenty sixth of november nineteen forty one a japanese attack fleet consisting of six aircraft carriers two battleships and hundreds of aircraft departed from japan and began the long journey to an assembly point two hundred and thirty miles north of the hawaiian island of awahu their target the u s pacific fleet anchored at pearl harbor scheduled for the seventh of december the attack would take the americans by complete surprise paralyzing their fleet for months and costing thousands of lives however the attack would also change the course of the second world war and spell ultimate doom for imperial japan so why did the japanese attack pearl harbour in the first place and how did japanese miscalculation in planning the attack doom them to defeat in the second world war well to answer that question we first meet to go back to the nineteen thirties so japan spent much of the early twentieth century modernizing its economy in its military so basely they wanted to build an empire sort of like that of great britain on the united states and from that they could extract natural resources exploit labor and build new trade routes and become one of the world's great powers but while japan had big ambitions there was one huge problem the japanese mainland did not have the natural resources required to build that empire japan needed to get its hands on more coal iron and in particular oil to make its ambitions a reality it was nineteen thirty one when japan took its first major step towards empire building invading the chinese province of manchuria now manchuria had many of the resources that japan needed and gave them a firmer foothold on the asian continent for future advances over the next few years japan poked and prodded its way further into northern china before all out war broke out between the two in july nineteen thirty sevenat first things went very well for the japanese they won victory after victory all the while carrying out major atrocities like the rape of nanking and the terryr bombing of chinese civilians which drew widespread international condemnation by nineteen thirty nine though the war had descended into a stale mate and as the chinese grew in strength the war became a serious drain on japanese man power and supplies to win they would have to look elsewhere for the resources they needed meanwhile across the pacific the u s was looking on with mounting concern after the u s as participation in the first world war they start to adopt a unofficial policy of non interventionism and isolation ism so this pesly means that they won't go to war for their allies or even get into alliances in the first place and they won't even provide aid either and this actually starts to become official policy in the mid nineteen thirties when the u s congress starts to pass a series of neutrality acts but as congress was passing these acts the world around the u s was getting a lot more violent and unstable so though america had begun the nineteen thirties as a bastion of isolationism the outbreak of war in europe as well as japanese atrocities in china brought a gradual shift in public opinion back towards interventionism that allowed u s president franklin d roosevelt to sign a new neutrality act into law in nineteen thirty nine which permitted the u s to supply arms to britain and france if they paid for and picked it up in their own ships this would later be followed up by the far more sweeping land lease in nineteen forty one which included china and the soviet union and asked for no payment in return so although the u s was still technically neutral it was very clear whose side they were on and for japan that was a huge problem so the biggest resource that japan needs at this point is oil in nineteen thirty nine all but six per cent of its oil supply was imported with roughly eighty per cent coming from the united states alone running out of oil  basicly spell doome for their military campaign in china as well as their other territorial ambitions there were also a host of other national resources that japan needed but could only get through imports and that included scrap metal coal iron all things that are vital to their war effort and actually a lot of this stuff also comes in the united states to get those resources and grow its empire japan had a choice to make between what became known as the northern and southern strategies the northern strategy was backed by the imperial japanese army and involved taking the oil coal and iron rich areas in china mongolia and siberia the southern strategy on the other hand was backed by the imperial japanese navy and instead involved striking south into british malaia and the dutch east indies similarly rich in oil and rubber by the mid nineteen thirties the northern plan was already in full swing with attacks in manchuria and china and this had led to border disputes with the soviets these culminated in the huge battle of calkin gaul in which the sovia mongolian forces won a major victory suddenly japan had to reconsider its plans so japan's defeat at calkin gaul basically pours cold water on their plans for northward expansion into siberia as does the signing of a non aggression pact between the soviet union and germany in august nineteen thirty nine when germany invades the soviet union during operation barbarossa in june nineteen forty one these plans for an invasion o siberia briefly reconsidered but japan is bogged down in china they're running out of natural resources and you know it just doesn't happen with the army bogged down in china it was the navy who took up the mantle as japan focused on its southern strategy instead this began in earnest in nineteen forty when in order to cut a qay chinese supply route japan entered the northern part of french indo china in an agreement with the vis french government this worked in isolating the chinese but the u s sawit as yet another act of japanese aggression that threatened u s interests in the pacific coupled with japan's recent alliance with nasi germany and italy the u s responded by imposing an embargo on iron steel and copper all of which were essential to japan's war industries and which were largely imported from the u s but the japanese did not learn their lesson and occupied even more of french indo china in july nineteen forty one as a launch point for invasions further south this time the americans responded even more forcefully so this time the u s response by freezing all japan's assets in the united states and this prevents japan from purchasing oil and right after this this is followed up bya britain and the netherlands who control the dutch east indes imposing oil embargoes of their own so in one fell sloop japan loses ninety four per cent of its oil supplies japan was in a crisis the first attempt to negotiate with the u s who demanded their immediate withdrawal from china and the tripartide pact but for japan accepting those demands was akin to complete defeat unwilling to give up their imperial ambitions the japanese felt their only option was to seize the natural resources they needed by force that meant striking further south into british milea and the dutch east indies who were both friendly with the u s japan believed that this time the u s would almost certainly respond to their invasion with force of their own the japanese decided then that they had to blunt that u s response by attacking the u s pacific fleet at anchor pearl harbor in hawaii by attacking pearl harbor japan believed that it can severely cripple the u s fleet and bidte time the pacific and southeast asia so not only would they be able to launch their attacks without interference from the u s they would also have time to dig in defensively and consolidate their gains so this is a really big gamble for japan they don't actually believe that they can win a long drawn out war with the u s so their strategy really hinges on a short war they believe that the u s probably won't have the stomach to fight a this costly war against the dug in enemy thousands of miles away across the pacific and they would instead negotiate for peace allowing japan to retain some or all its captured territories on december seventh nineteen forty one those plans were finally put into action at seven fifty five a m the first attack wave of a hundred and eighty three aircraft appeared in the skies over pearl harbor the americans were taken completely by surprise the wave was separated into three groups the first two groups of dive bombers and fighters targeted the hangers and part aircraft of the islands air base the aircraft there were stored wing tip to wing tip to prevent sabatacks  but that made them easy pickings of the japanese the other group of bombers and torpedo bombers targeted the ships in the harbour in particular the battleships of battleship rome the americans believed that the water was to shallow for a torpedo attack but the japanese had created a brand new kind of torpedo specifically designed for the waters of pearl harbour and it had a devastating effect within the first five minutes of the attack four battle ships were hit including the u s s oklahoma and the u s s arizona which exploded ten minutes later killing one thousand one hundred seventy five of its crew at eight fifty four the second attack wave of a hundred seventy aircraft began their attack they were also separated to three groups attacking mostly the same targets but with the base now on high alert their attacks were less successful in the space of just over an hour the japanese had sunk or damaged eighteen american warships including hits to all eight of the fleets battleships they destroyed a hundred eighty eight aircraft and severely damaged the bases infer structure crucially though the three all important u s aircraft carriers were out on manoeuvres at the time of the attack and escaped unscated so because japan are sort of anticipating thes short war that's going to lead to negotiations  their target selection focus on the battleships which are gongto prevent the u s specific fleet from coming out into the pacific and southeast asia and stopping the japanese and they're not thinking about things like the field depots and the repair shops that are actually going to allow america to pursue a longer war in the pacific the shallow depths meant that any ships that sunk they didn't sink far down so they were much easier to recover almost half of the deaths that day on the u s side were from the u s s arizona when it was hit and exploded and the imperial war museum in london actually has a piece of the u s s arizona on display in its new second world war galleries and this is actually the first time that part of the u s s arizona has been displayed outside of the united states initially the attack worked perfectly on the same day japanese launched more or less simultaneous attacks in the pacific and southeast asia tie land surrendered within ours and quickly signed an alliance with japan while the u s territories of gwam wake island and the philippines as well as the british territories of malaya and hong kong all fell relatively quickly and on top of that two major british warships the h m s prince of wales and h m s repulse were sunk off the coast of malaya by japanese torpedo bombers in the first months of nineteen forty two japan followed this up with attacks on the dutch east indies british burma and singapore new guinea and the solomon islands and just as they had hoped the u s pacific fleet was unable to offer a response the japanese then had completed their goal with speed and efficiency they had established their new empire and finally had the natural resources they had craved for so long but there was one huge problem so japan's attack on perl harbor pretty much has the opposite effect of what e was hoping for remember they were hoping for this negotiated peace so the day after the attack president roosevelt delivers his famous day of infamy speech to congress in which he asks for a formal declaration of war against japan which congress quickly authorizes so the u s is officially now in the war the vast resources of the united states pa raw materials industrial production all had to be mobilized to meet the demands of total so support for isolationism quickly melts away there's a rapid expansion of the u s military with a hundreds of thousands of men volunteering to join and the economy is fully mobilized on to a war footing japan hopes for a short war completely evaporate and theyve now awoke in this what many people call the sleeping giant and they are now committed to this long war in the pacific and southeast asia which ultimately they'll lose the japanese attack at puarl harbor was a huge gamble and one which did not pay off japan's desire for an empire and the natural resources to go with it had slowly awoken the u s from its isolationism bogged down in china and unable to attack the soviets the japanese decision to strike south resulted in a u s oil embargo which gave japan little choice other than to give up its ambitions or go to war their decision to fight paid off in a short term but once the u s had geared up its war machine for japan there was little hope of victory", "summary": [" a
