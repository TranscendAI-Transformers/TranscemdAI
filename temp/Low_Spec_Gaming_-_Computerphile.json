{"text": "what do you stap with videis is that why we still here  e were ousto that's a really good question star west so when a game making a game is specific bido the first thing that i always research is what engine is the game use in because there's a lot of extendarisation in the industry and it's very common for most of the big games that are coming out to be on five or six major engines especially because up keeping an engine accustomed engine has become such an expensive task that most studious ous license some other engine too to use and often that means that if there's a moving or mortifying community if there's a community of people who are examining previous games of the same engine there's a lot of things that you can learn from that that you can use even in olther versions of the engine very often when a new game comes out which is the first game in a new version of an engine the first thing that i will do is like research developer decommentation for the previous version of the engine because they they tend to be a lot of things that still cross over traditionally a good number of piecy games store the variables that the game uses to set up its graphic in a series of files if you are lucky at is files are use ar reachable and that means that you can play around with them most engines have a deb consul like the lineex terminal like any consula you wild think most of the time is not used or reachable sometimes it is anyoujus have to press the right letter and it comes out in olther games it used to be always reachable but it sadly it's become a less common thing and from there it's a matter of experiment in ok like let me let me let me find a very specific example frost bite which is the engine used by the battlefield games battlefield games still allow usor access to the consul so a new battlefield game comes out first thing i do is i know they're opiable that you can add to the launch commands of the e x  that enables that developer consul then i start a game and i press the tilda button and i opens the consul and n look ok let's see if there's outar complete and i will start writing things and see if it's out o completing command stimeli like o k if i press tab does it out o complete it to me o k so use in that i will search if there's a command like list all list command valuables or something to see if i can get a dump of all the things that are inside ther that i can play around with if not then it becomes a very painful process of going a and then pressin tab and oute complete and see what comes out and like taking sqeen chuts and documenting all little valuables that are inside and then from the names of the valyable experiment in a trying to guess which ones are the ones that have to do with graphical fidelity or graphic rendering in general and and start changing values see if they can be changed at ron time see if those values i can put in a certain file and they will read them and see if wel change the game a lot of it is guesswork but once you sort of figure a certain engine a lot of the games on the same engine to intend to do something similar for metal gear solid five that's probably my favorite most proud case metal gear solid five runs in something they call the fox engine and that engine wasn't made for b c and you can often tell when an engine wasn't made by for b c because it has no configuration files its all like a black box it's all super contained but i really really like this game and i really wanted to make a vilou about it so i was exploring what to do and i came through a the game had a pretty big moding community there were people making like model swaps there were people introducing like new weapons in a game through mots and i kept telling myself like o k but how did they figure this out like how they did this so i started doing some detective work and this mod is taken from this mod that is takin from this mod that started digging diggig digging digging and found the first mods of the game and reversed gogle searched them and traced them back to like a couple of foin post posts so i searched that entire fom thread and i went through like the first post and started reading them and it was upposed about like the performance of the game but half way through like post three hundred or something some one figured out how a how the the game encripted its files and created like a set of commands that you could do do ing an crip them and someone made a tool about it and people started experimenting and mudding with it and i remember finding the pir specific post of someone who went hay i uncript the defiles i realize there's this folder here which has a bunch of l u a scripts which are what the game runs every time you change a graphical setting so and this is often how games do it like when you said shadows too low the game will search up a script and it will be like ok shadows too low means that this resolution is said to this this resolution is said to this and this draw distance is said to this so they have this on different bockets and i remember seeing that an being like al but now that i have access to this file i can change what that scrip does and i cold instead of lowering the resolution of shadows i could make them not draw shadows at all and i started doing this sort of thing and created basically a scrip that you could put in replace the normal scrip of the game and it will basically li not draw shadows and use a lower resolution texture than what i usually will do and it will be immediately obvious why to developer didn't do is because it really screw up with the dynamic lighting system of the game oh but befor it was like a thirty five performance game so yes that was amaze i remembered i was so proud of that in putting a vidio about it and some one else took what i did in the vidio and created a mud which was called like the potato metalger mud or something in retrospective i wish i could have thought of that and i could have published the mud instead of him a but yes that was that was an interesting contribution that i could do to that community and and that was a very fun process like digging figuring out how to ncrept it and seeing all those files they and played aroud with them that that that always makes my lays always really fun the far cry games run on i remember the name of the engine i used but it's the same one for all the far cry games just different persions of the same engine and it has configuration fouls that i read everything in x am el so i thought to myself at you can just probably find things there and change them but i wouldn't really read anything and ah i could not do like a really good badio on severalo most farker games for a while so i consulted with my discort community and some one reminded me that i think farcry three or four has a decent motin community so altogether we started looking through the ducomentation of the motin community it had a bunch of incrypted configuration scripts that as most games do wo execute when you set up anthe specific settings and people were puing around with those so i started trying to basicall what i did with metal ger and figured it out if i could replace them and some very bold person from my discourt just decided to copy all the badiables from those hidden in crypted confuguration fils copy and paste them on the normal exem user reachable examel and the game read them all like the the game read all the valiables that were not supposed to be on that file perfectly flawlessly and from that discovery we were able to for example mo dramatically modify the drawdistance of different elements of the game so you will have enemies three meters in front of you and they would not be rendering and you could like it was obviously very unpractical but it was something that you could play around with for extra performance and from that we made some interesting discoveries so an l o d system in balio games is basically andm in a nutshell because its a bberbic topic is when you create different versions of the models inside games that have different quantities of polygons or different quantities of details and ten lhey low detail ones you display far off into the distance and if that thing gets close to you you gradually replace them for more detail models that way you conserve the pecs resources and a player doesn't really have to notice that is happening but those usually are set to distances so x quantity of pixles you load a different model double x quantity of pixles you low a different model when you play around with that interesting things happen for example in the far cry games a yo different objects seem to be in different buckets in terms of if they are drawn or not or if they use a lower version model or not i think higher priority buckets or drawn farther which are critical things that the  player needs to notice and not so important stuff tends to be not rendered at the same distance now there's the game calleda far cry primo which he happens to  in the stone age we notice that the cloting of the cavemen was in a different bucket that the cavemen themselves and that means that if you set at really low value of dradistance if you were a certain distance from the cavemen they will be completely naked until you get close to them and their clothes will render so you will see them completely naked at a distance and you will try to get clothes on the clothe an the clothes will appear and it it makes you wonder how they sort of created this game but those are the interesting things that happen when you sort o play around with the inside bariables of a game that you were not supposed to reach in the first place and to their credit the valiables that the far cry engine reads directly from the use reachable x m el they have not been fixed to this day the last game in the farcry franchise  has was release was far cry ew on and i just copied over the same set of valuables that i have been using for every far cry bidio work at the first try so thank you for that far cry tan thank you yubisef please continue doing that that is just  very fun that you can poke around in that eighty ninety per cent of the work that i do is simply figuring out what are the variables that the game is loading when you set up a graphical setting or when the engine is loading on the first time trying to see what are the names try to see wher the maximum and minimum values and trying to see if you can make them breet at the minimum values and see what happens from there it will be i think it will be healthier for the tor biecy game in necal system if we get more and more games that allow that sort of control over most variables a good example of someone who does that is it so the new newest versions of the it engine used by the latest domand wolfenstein games they have an userricable developer consul it's you settle the abarable and the lunch commencs of the game and you press tithat and it opens up in most games and from there you can not only play with a lot of the graphical settings but also activate things like godmode or infinite amo like you can use it for actual cheats but what i have always liked about this games is that if you open up the deaf consul and you type anything you get a message that says you have enable debmode and you will not get any achievements on the game like and i think that's a fair deal you can play around with the game all you want you can set up custom settings you can play around with your graphical settings in no supportinate ways the game is just making sure you are not cheating your way into achievements seems like a fair deal to me andand i wish more games thid this because this is something that you can a lot of players can get a lot of benefit out of and i have discovered a couple of things under undatdive consul that makes both the new doom of the new wolfenstein games way more accessible and lowin pieces a so that is a tradition that i et i hope it continues the worst cases are the games that are complete just bad ports from consuls they will try to grab the cod base from the consul and ly adapted as best as possible with limited resources to pece that means not many graphical settings that means often than you will find quirks  thes two two examples come to mind a near automata and the latest monster hunter game both of these game and this is not mesint this is was a community discovery a lot of people sorty poking around the games and started realizing that the games use timing systems are very common for consols but when you use that sort of system to calculate your timing on a pic it cast i stuttering so when you notice stuff like that you're like i if it's a little bit irritating especially because there's a tool that the guy who did the discovery developed a tool that will in real time intersect the calls that the game will be doing on the coat and replace them with calls that were more efficient for pece and he has been he added a lot of different things to the stool that improve the improve the cepio performance of monster hunter by a lot and that allow things like changingt the global illumination for a near automata which completely makes the game playable in like anything that i owned otherwise it will have been impossible am so from time to time the work is corred out to me by some one else who make this marvellous species of soffwere am but these species of soffware sort of exist because some one noticed that the code was writhing specifically for consul and i still has the quirks related to it and it's ol ten to the community to fix it which isn't exactly morally right but at least am glad that it exists so we can get to enjoy the cames these are the kind of things that people who are writing computer games not me people who know whathey're doing writing computer games are thinking about how can we do post processing like motion bler and an am bloom and other kinds of filters that look good in ta game but don't grind the whole thing to", "summary": [" when a game making
