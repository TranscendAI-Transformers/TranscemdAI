{"text": "professor ellsford a lot of people talk about von noman architecture and we've talked about babbage we've talked about churing who was von noman we've done a lot about churing we've done a fair bit about babbage in the generation earlier in fact a lot of people i guess in the english speaking world would regard churing in some way as being the father of computing it came up with this very important result in the mid thirties about what was computable and as we now know he to his credit he wasn't at all afraid to burn himself with soldring iron and tried to create hardware which he did at bletley park during the war so yes if he's the father if babbage was the grandfather and if ada countess of lovelace was the great aunt then who on earth was john von norman and why is he mentioned alongside turing well right at the out sir let's say john von noyman was the impossibly talented impossibly carismatic very wealthy uncle to computing it was he that in the mid nineteen forties in a way made it all happen by the force of his own personality and kept it not just in an enclosed community but encouraged all those who wanted to build general purpose computers to come along to this summer school and do it but that really i guess is in the future it's where we've got to get to in the von norman story but yes you're quite right shorn to say that one of the first phrases that almost any computer scientist hear's about is the von noman architecture for computers which to a large extent we still follow even now all of what sixty seventy years later so we've mentioned edsack before we'll be coming back to mention this very important early computer again but it is a von neman machine and all its saying is it's very simple to build a computer you need a store or memory as it's more commonly called nowadays to hold your instructions and your data you need a control unit often called a c p u now and you need an arithmetic capability the a l u the arithmetic and logic unit again many of you will know that in modern chips those two are often combined into what we just call the c p u chip nowadays and you need input devices of various sorts leading back to people's teletypes input output devices for back up storage disk and so on you need to beual to do inpurt and output so there it is it's just one two three four five boxes that is the von noyman architecture and it's very very similar to day there was a big debate at the time about that stall that memory shouldn't you for safety's sake put the instructions of your programme in a different sort of memory to your data wouldn't it be safer to do that better in some ways on the other hand clearly if you' got a good memory technology that works the temptation might be just to put them in separate areas of that same technology and try and take some sort of precaution about them not interfering with each other in edsack the only way to get into a subrooting and get back out of it again was to override part of your programm instructions let's just return back to this incredible character john von norman how does he fit in alongside allan churing well like i said he's the older impossibly talented uncle did curing and von norman know each other oh yes they did they were both basically trained as mathematicians von norman it's hard to know where to begin and where to end you can't exaggerate enough about how good he was he was hungarian and his hungarian name where they give surnames first was i think noman janoch er his father was very very wealthy and when von noyman was quite young the family became ennobled in hungary became basically at the level of barren hereditary baron i think over here janosh was very talented he was a child of prodigy he could divide one eight digit number by another eight digit number in a fraction of a second when he was aged about six he loved history he was a multi talented polymat he easily came top of the class he effortlessly took in detail and that's the first thing that all his mathematics contemporaries said about him was his sheer speed at picking up new ideas and seeing the ramifications of them so he was notorious even as a t nager and as a mathsundergrad he did his early education i think up to ph d levell in budapest he almost naturally ended up at a place we've mentioned before in connection with girdle and hilbert and talking of course about guttingan university in germany so noman yanosh makes the journey vira p h da to becoming effectively the research assistant to the super star david hilbert at guttingam but because his family had been a nobles he's not janosh neman any more noman yanosh sorry he's johan von neman impossibly talented hilbertis supervisor at a seminag given by by johnny john johan er asked who his tailor was because this impossibly smart pinstripe suit was just a complete knockout so he was a legend almost the moment he got there and er did some fabulously important work there it was obvious that for somebody of his talents he was going to get a full professorship very quickly indeed er i think he became impatient and waiting for it to happen at any german university so in the late thirties thirty seven thirty eight somewhere round there anyway he got an offer from princeton in new jersey and that was i don't know very timely it all fitted in together very well as part of his tours of europe giving seminars and on his way to princeton i think he met turing in the mid thirties in cambridge because he gave seminars there and i think a lot of mutual respect grew up i mean obviously turing being in of von norman wouldn't be so exceptional but after that nineteen thirty six paper of turings about decidability following on from gerdel and all that von noyman rated turing there as no question about that this was evidenced by the fact you will recall those of youve seen my previous vidios that turing also took a sematical and worked with alonzo church at princeton well von norman was there by that time von neyman was such a super star they not only made him professor of mathematics at princeton at an absurdly early age probably about thirty something like that but some of you are recalled right next door to princeton about a mile and a half across the meadows is the institute for advanced studies which had been endowed in the ill in nineteen thirties by a multi millionaire and this really was the ultimate club to be invited to join you got to be of the quality of einstein who accepted the invitation herman vile one of the founders of quanta mechanics girdle we know about girdle girdle was invited to just come to i a s institute of advancetes at princeton stay as long as you like yes you're a professor everything found food accommodation a lot all we want is to have the greatest minds here von neman was offered a professorship in that community i think a aged thirty five may be slightly younger unbelievably young he'd hardly been at princeton a year or two as an ordinary mathematics professor everybody thought this is a truly phenomenal person he reminded many people of absolute superstiles like newton gaus oyler einstein hilbert himself even at early to mid thirties they could see that potential in him there so yes turing visits princeton in nineteen thirty eight worked with alonzo church but also of course had frequent interactions at seminels with von noyman and then came the big question if you recall for allan turing should i return to england and do my patriotic duty according to andrew hodge's definitive biography of turing turing's father was all for turing staying in princeton you know keep out the war get a prodigious mathematic job and that was underlined by the fact that von noman offered turing a job he basically said turing would you like to be my research assistant at the institute for advance studies now turing could see straightway that just would just make you as a mathematician you were invited by the great von noman to be his research assistant at i a s only problem was i think first of all i think allan turing did feel a certain patriotism in wanting to come home and do his bit there was also the worry that at that time von noymann had not properly got into computing he had not turned his considerable talents to considering it and for the research assistantship he wanted allan turing to do quanta mechanics another of von norman's great love and i don't think turing was keen on that because he knew from experience at cambridge where he tried doing mathematical physics it really wasn't his arena at all so he politely declined with great thanks came back to england and the rest if you like is more or less history now there's johnny as he'd now become johann von noman speaker of four five languages including italian and english once he transferred from guttingan to princeton wanted to become the all american genius so he was on more formal occasions he was just john von norman but to his friends he was johnny oh you can't exaggerates enough omily his wife said he can count everything but calories he was fond of food and drink the champagne parties the glits the glamour the girl friends good old johnny he absolutely was the antithesis of the shy mathematician he was all encompassing and everybody who met him was just stunned by how he could see his way through problems in no time flat and just do impossible things and so e was there in a very very nice position institute for advanced studies even before the americans joined the war but he stayed there throughout the war but being who he was he was endlessly in demand to be a consultant and most famously along with people like j robert oppenheimer he was one of the consultants employed on the manhattan project the atomic bomb and the hydrogen bomb but he was used by the army the u s navy the air force everybody wanted johnny as their consultant and this even included as the war developed the fact that one of the earliest computers which we have mentioned in a previous vidio was university of pennsylvania more school of engineering they helped develop the eniac which if you remember was a vacuum tube computer running on decimal arithmetic and initially devoted to gunnery trajectory calculations it was a bit late in nineteen forty six to be of direct strategic using gunnery actually johnny who by this time of course was a consultant to the moore school devised a way i think to turn eniac into being a general purpose computer although it wasn't a very efficient one and i believe he used it for some calculations relevant to the atomic bomb and all that kind of thing the natural question arising with everybody at the end of the war went like this we all know or even though its top secret at blexley park we have heard gentle rumours that computers are being developed all over the place and you've always got to say are they special purpose are they general purpose are they binery are they decimal er are they fully electronic or are they electromechanical and literally there must have been at least a dozen machines round that satisfied some of these criteria  if you ask germans about who's the fav of computing they say conrad zosa he developed electro mechanical machines that were turingcomplete and calculated things but they never got beyond electromechanical you get onto electronic ones you get atomasonfon berrys electronic valve driven thing special purpose though could solve certain differential equations and even tommy flowers and colossus we know special purpose can decrip tonny traffic lawrence cipher as it later became known as so you've got everything happening that if it's general purpose it's not yet electronic if it's special purpose it is electronic but we want it to be general purpose so at the end of the warit was the perfect time to get everybody together and say look now that the war's over we all want to find the way to do it correctly to build general purpose probably binary base because they're more reliable all electronic digital computers how do we do it and who better to lead the charge and run a summer school and be associated with it than uncle johnny of course and the more school at pennsylvania to their great credit did this they decided that the successor to eniac would be a thing called edvac they said yes going to take us three or four years to do this but in the meantime here we are nineteen forty six why not all of you all over the world who are interested in the quest to build general purpose all electronic digital computers probably based on the minery system well hold a summer school in the more school of engineering nineteen forty six welcome everybody did turing go to it he was i believe at that time at the national physical laborataory in the u k no he didn't hated conferences did churing he wasn't a clubable character couldn't stand small talk classic shy mathematician not at all like von neyman rait so churing wasn't if you like the u k representative the er and one wonders whether he would also have been held back by bletchley park and the official secrets act as he'd only just left a few years before the representative from the u k was somebody who was churing's exact contemporary they had both done mathematics in the early nineteen thirties at cambridge they had both got first class degrees did they get on not very well but who's this other person his name is morris wilkes morris vincent wilkes and by the vagaries of job allocations around about word water he didn't end up at blechley park did morris he ended up in radar but he knew enough about mathematics and electronics to be in a good position to do or make a von noman machine in the u k in the period from about nineteen forty six onwards but we'd better stop there because morris and his headsack is an extra story and this depends on the value being fetched from there i'm just going to show this as an arrow here but the next instruction load ar to om a see tat doesn't depend on anything", "summary": [" a lot of people talk about von noman
