{"text": "star bucks has coffee shops all over the world there are more than twenty eight thousand locations and seventy six markets from shanghai to quantanimo bay and in china a new starbuok location opens up every fifteen hours but there is one continent that seems uninterested in the hipe over the seattle base coffee chain and that continent is australia it's proven to be one of the toughest markets in the world to break into so tough in fact that star buoks closed more than two thirds of its stores on the continent back in two thousand eight so what went so wrong with star buoks in australia to answer that let's go back to july of two thousand when star buoks opened its first australian shop in sydney from there it expanded fast by two thousand eight star boks had eighty seven stores across the continent i think ote o the problems  starbi   for a lot of business in to thingssssful in one country is that they thought that their business problem had just rolle out to a different enviroment and there was no need for them to adjust but that was the problem it tried to grow the empire too fast star books rapidly opened up multiple locations instead of slowly integrating them into the australian market when they launched they launched too rapidly and didn't give the australian consumer an opportunity to really developit half a time before the starbucks brance they also moved into regional areas into outer suburbs of danger cities and sofo the australian conchiement was almost like it was too available for them and so there wasn't this point of difference is want its need for star box and it wasn't an organic growth wich is what we very much saw in the u s in its first seven years in australia star books accumulated a hundred and five million dollars in losses by two thousand seven star box australia was hanging on by a thread taking big loans from the u s totaling up to fifty four million dollars and in two thousand eight star boks annouced hat was shutting down sixty one stores but of course two thousand eight was the difficult time for businesses due to the financial crisis along with the australia closures star books also closed six hundred under performing american stores but even still such a retreet in australia was embarrassing for the brand went to shutting down seventy five stores o for the australianssume when they when they did leave the market  for at least a large number of testors was shut down they didn't really care it's partly because australians are spoiled for choice when it comes to coffee australia's coffee market is one of the biggest in the world the industry is expected to hit more than six billion dollars in total revenue in twenty eighteen they've been immersed in nuances of cafe culture since the mid nineteen hundred when italian and greek emigrants began travelling to the country the emigrants introduced australians to expresso by the nineteen eighties australians were fully engulfed in cafe culture they've also grown accustomed to specialty manu items like a flat white or an australian machiato so cafes in australia were born out of ike the italian culture of amena meting of friends and knowing your local garista andit being kind of like a local meeting place where everyone knew each other and that coffee was just a part of that and then starbucks came in with what is more of an american star like coffee culture which is essentially just like coffee is a product coffee is a commodity coffee is like thy cork meg off in the morning its calf a nation starbooks had a basic menu and offered more sugary drinks which most australians didn't like in australia weave yo don't like the taste of different t we don't really watt a coffee a the a hundreds of ounces lots of sugar and evreone something tha hat more sophisticated plus star books charged more than local cafes so australians instead opted to pay less for coffee they liked from a local barista they trusted so when you come in with these tegs i ca we gongto open all these cafesd and theyreall going to be togo focus it tus was the complete wrong market o what what the australian was used to but there's one american coffee company that's thriving in australia founded in chicago and now base in australia gloria jeans got the traction in australia that star books couldn't gloria jeanes has more than four hundred australian locations and serves more than thirty five million consumers in australia each year so what is gloria jeanes doing in australia that starboks isn't well the company attribute it success to two australians who franchised the business in their home country shop started to show up in australia in nineteen ninety six fast forward to to day the company has a presence in every australian state the reason it's menu the chain offers a wide variety of aspresso drinks and specialty coffee failing to adapt its menu to australian coffee culture proved to be a mistake for star books and the company faces another challenge later this year italy star bock is opening its first store in milan in late two thousand eighteen home of the aspresso italy is rich in cafe culture but according to starbucks it's not going to make the same mistakes that it did in australia the company said that it would develop in italy with humility and respect for its coffee culture it announced it t would be opening a roastery which is not your average cafe it gives customers a chance to see coffee beans roasted and process before their eyes so there's a chance that it won't struggle like it did in australia but star books isn't admitting defeat in australia either starbucks is stagind would come back on the continent in twenty fourteen starbucks locations in australia were purchased by the mount waverley base withers group star buck told seen be see that since it sailed to the withers group the company learned a lot so this time it's taken a different approach to putting star books on the continent so y just think abot astralias i touris distination  otus a chinese tourists aos  been very successful in china and and it makes a lot of sants for them to build out because there are people looking for something that's familiar to them now with thirty nine locations in brisbon melbourne the gold coast and sinny areas this time it's not looking to appeal to australians but instead the coffee giant hopes to be a familiar face for tourists visiting popular vacation destinations in australia  australias always bang a high volume tourist mocket ot the same bheing intended international studen to i e cities ot potential opportunities for them and with starting to say o stobots enter into som lodge tropping moles u here in australia as well australia welcome nine million tourists from twenty seventeen to twenty eighteen and those international visitors spent more than thirty billion dollars in twenty seventeen alone so tourist could possibly be the key tho keeping the company afloat and preventing another downfall hey there thanks for checking out c and b c on yu tube be sure to subscribe to say up to date on all the day's biggest stories
