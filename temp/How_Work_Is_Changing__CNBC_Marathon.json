one thousand people working in the leisure and hospitality industry which includes hotels and restaurants another one point three million workers were laid off or discharged by their employer jessica

didn't hear anything from the owner until i think it was the day before when he was going to oka wer reopening there was no communication nothing so for me that kind of just made me want to get out of that industry in august twenty twenty one the separation rate for hotel and food service workers which includes quits lay offs and retirements increased to eight point three per cent from six point seven per cent the month prior and while the pendemic has caused a severe blow to employment over all it is especially impacted working mothers as of january twenty twenty one there were eighteen point five million u s mothers living with their school aged children while actively working eight per cent less than a year earlier on the advice of her brother in law jeska applied for a job at the

benefits ranging from paid vacation to health insurance and according to a may twenty twenty one survey jeska is not alone almost half o workers pulled said they are rethinking the type of job they want in future more than half said they would retrain for a new career if they had the opportunity i feel like i'm always trying to find balance in my life balancing with working and all the kid stuff my relationsip with my husband every day it's like o k halmigan ad this how are you to get through this according to n august twenty twenty one study almost a third of workers at large u s companies say they are likely to change jobs in the coming year younger workers are even more likely to uproot their careers half of jn z workers particularly those struggling with productivity and time pressure issues at work plann a switch jobs in the coming year according to one financial planner there are three solutions to remedy a non ideal work situation for starters small changes can make a big difference the easiest and least destructive way forward for you and your company is to tweat the job you already have so i would encourage employees to go have what i would call a job grafting conversation with their manager and say i love the sixty per cent to tworty per cent not so much what can we do and that could be everything from maybe you just cut back to three days a week and your job becomes a smaller job volunteering or side hustle could be another way to cultivate experience and explore new industries another benefit after a couple months you can stop continue or test out something else and finally if you're in a job that is mentally or physically trying has a poor work life balance or limited growth opportunities that may be a signal at time to look for a new job but before quitting financial plan of roger maw advises to take a look at your financial situation and find out how much it costs to fund your life style then once you know that number let's say that your expenses are fifty thousand and to be able to fund that you need to make eighty thousand dollars then you can start to look at what are the rolls what are the positions what are the industries that pay that amount it might be rolls in a similar industry that you're in or maybe you've been in your industry for a while ad yo're looking to pivit while searching for a new gig financial advisers say it's easier to find a new job if you already have one and it also puts you in a better position to negotiate your salary leaving on good terms is another tip even though you may think i will never come back to this company again a little insurance policy would be leaving on the best known possible so maybe you leave that door open some ere hanging back at some point in the future ou s has seen a record number of people quit their jobs but what's led to the boom and resignations several factors according to anthony clots associate professor of management at texas anam university for starters the pandemic forced americans to take a hard look at their lives and re evaluate their careers but as a result of the deep thinking that people did during the pandemic i reasoned that a number of them would plan life pivots coming out of that sometimes those life pivots would not involve a job change but in many cases because of how central careers are to our livesitit would necessitate a career change working from home was another factor according to clot a number of people who worked remotely at the start of the pandemic have been unwilling to give up their autonomy i think what we're finding as a number of employees who worked remotely felt like they could be more of themselves than they could in the office and maybe in some cases they felt like there was less harassment less microagressions where the clothes that they wanted o har the way they want burn out and mental health are another component according to one survey longer work weeks have become even more embedded in business culture and the boundary between work and personal life has shrunk more than forty per cent of workers at large u s companies so they had difficulty setting work an personal life boundaries and almost forty five per cent so they felt pressure to be reachable at all times there were lots of reports that burn out was at all times hies for individuals and burn out is a pretty prlear predictor of people quitting their jobs increased economic independence has also led to the rise of resignations according to an august twenty twenty one study from oxford economics americans saved an additional four trillion dollars during the cobe pandemic while about seventy per cent of that game went to the wealthiest twenty per cent of americans analysts say the economic uncertainty of twenty twenty force many people to delay their retirement plans until twenty twenty one my senses early retirements are up people taking a break from the work force like their own smaticalum is up and that supported by twenty twenty was only the second year in the last thirty five years where american household thet actually went down businesses across the u s are struggling to find workers in august twenty twenty one there were ten point four million job openings across the country according to c three twenty twenty one c and b c survey half of small business owners say it's harder to find competent people to hire than a year ago and nearly a third say they have jobs they haven't been able to fill for at least three months but while the number of job openings has reached historic proportions it migt not be an entirely new phenomenon since the burea of labor statistics began tracking this back in two thousand the rate of employee resignations permonth has gone up fairly steadily over the past twenty years to entice workers back employers have come up with insendids ranging from college tuition to signing bonuses in august twenty twenty one target announced a programm to pay a hundred per cent of its workers college tuition the big box retailer said in addition to tuition it would cover text books and fees for employees pursuing two hundred and fifty college programmes at more than forty institutions chipotley starbok and walmart offer similar debt free education programmes other companies have boosted pay mac donalds announced t in may it was raising hourly wages at company own restaurants walmart under armor and wall grads have announced similar pay hikes and according to analysts hiring new employees is only half the battle companies face a steep penalty if they are unable to retain employees they already have i think it's incredibly expensive to lose talent and especially a lot of talent and so that you've got the loss of maybe this person has been thinking about it for some time they're unhappy so you're not getting the mosts out of them while they're there and then you know eventually when they decide to leave you might have to spend several months to be able to attract new talent according to a twenty seventeenth study by the work institute based on a medium u s salary of forty five thousand dollars the average cost of turnover per employee is fifteen thousand dollars that figure includes direct costs like exit processing and relocation expenses as well as training cost and lost productivity according to the group the cost to u s employers from worker resignations in twenty sixteen alone was five hundred thirty six billion dollars but despite these issues anas say that the wave of resignations we are experiencing could ultimately lead to an improvement for the lives of both workers and the organizations that employ them i think the one silver line out of this is that the pandemic has gotten people to review or question things that they've done in the past and maybe if you have been an auto pilot it's given you that kick to say you know this job i've been on auto pilot this doesn't really aline with my interests or my long term goals and i'm going to make a change with this many resignations that means there's lots of talented employees who aren't working right now for any number of reasons and so a lot of organizations see that is an opportunity as well to improve their organizationdand improve their talents fo this is one example of quiet quitting a trend that has been dominating social media and especially tikta in july zid khan a twenty four year old engineer from new york posted a vidio about quiet quitting and it went viral since then the trend has spread like wildfire with hash taks like quiet quitting quitting and quieting does anybody want to work any more then the main stream media began covering it like working overtime no thanks late nie males ignore those quiet quitting is a really bad idea if you're a quiet quitter you're not working for me the world is changing and the way of work is changing even people saying i'm not going back to the office and if i do i'm definitely quiet quitting until i find a job that is a lot more flexible cobet was the ultimate reset cobet was that moment where people starte to ask a bigger question what do i want for my life do i want to continue working the way that i have or do i want something different do i want to continue to work which is awesome but do i also want to be able to enjoy my family do i also want to be able to enjoy my life so i think all these things are coming at stages and that they're quite quitting is just the trend that's come as a result of the ultimate recept which is cald something like forty per cent of workers are now saying they planned to change jobs this year the pandemic also triggered the great resignation eretan people but they're really runin scared millions of americans quit their jobs in twenty twenty one some for better opportunities some for a career break the pace of quitting continued well into twenty twenty two this chart tracts job openings and labor turnover in the u s economy jolts for short we do think that qui quitting is part of the great resignation story so it fits intoto the general story of a having a high level of quits over the past a year year and a half and certainly a very tight labor market and that type of labor market makes a lot of sense that workers may not be willing to work as hard as they have in the past ecause it's very easy to get alternative employment so the question is what is quiet quitting quiet quitting is referring to a situation where employees are making a choice to not necessarily go above and beyond what they're being asked to do it doesn't mean that they're not doing their job they're just not going above and beyond as myday was called co for me my last time quiet quitting was five years ago i used to be in text sales what i did was work less i wasn't putting in the forty hours any more i wasn't giving in to the drama any more i wasn't giving into work gossip any more i wasn't answering emils or texts or slack messages o dams after the workdays the week ends were free they were mine even though it's millennials and ginzeers who are actively talking about oun social media quiet quitting has been happening amongst gin extras which i'm partgin extras for the better part of two to three years the anti work movement is not a new trend in twenty twenty one the lying flat or tang ping movement took off in china many viewed it as an anti work phenomenon this is a labor protest movement in china against the country's relentless work culture some argue that quiet quitting is similar to the lying flat movement in the u s quiet quitting could also be a back lash to hustle culture the twenty four seven start up grind popularized by figures like garry v and others i think it is almost direct resistance and disruption of hustle culture honestly and i think it's exciting that more people are doing it when it comes to hustle culture and quiet quitting we're seeing from gensiers especially that they're really focused on insuring that they have that work life balance and really mission driven purpose when it comes to work and we see this across millennials as well people are being more honest about the fact that they just don't want to get beyond the forty hours of work that they normally would get because they're tired there has been a sunomy of job resignations twenty twenty one the great resignation dominated the economic news cycle or need to remain in their roles so in the second quarter of the same year u s productivity data posted its biggest ever annual drop and some economists blame workers leaving jobs or not trying hard at their current jobs for the hit to productivity pi quitting is probably part of the reason for the slowing in labor productivity it's hard to tell ah from accurate data exactly why labor productivityes has slowed so much o the course of the pandemic but it is certainly one of the reasons that you would expect to be weighing on o labor productivity right now employee engagement also appears to be declining a recent pole from gallop showed employee engagement in the u s dropping for the first annual decline in a decade dipping from thirty six per cent engaged employees and twenty twenty to thirty four per cent in twenty twenty one disengagement not being engaged that's affecting the productivity mentally they're just not there and they really aren't giving it their all any more and they are just trying to stay our under the radar and they are disengaged that's very much an impact productivity i do think quiet quitting is a part of the great resignation people are so burnt out we've just gone through and are still going through a pandemic we are recognizing that life can be so fleeting and so short and we want to spend it doing something we love and that doesn't mean a work has to be our dream job i think that myth of the dream job is slowly or rapidly dying people that shut down their lap top at five want that balance in life want to go to the stocker game nine to five only they don't work for me i can tell you that labor demand remains red hot in twenty twenty two that's despite the looming risk of a recession an economic down turn could make quiet quitting a short lived trend well if the labor market were to turn you'd imagine that quiet quitting would become less of a phenomenon well the risk if you're a quiet quitter is that the economy would slow and you could find yourself in a situation wherein you're in a job where you haven't been given the most effort that you can and it puts you at a disadvantage in terms of moving forward at that job if others have been giving more effort they are more likely to have a greater job security than otherwise so certainly as the labor market slows and if we were to go into recession cond potentially put those workers at a disadvantage in a distance tof talk of the thousands of employes per year i talk to thousands of leaders r all the way from your supervisor all the way up to your ca sweet c o and i will tell you that they are bothered by this trend because it speaks one of two things one we have employees who are doing their job but they're not going above and beyond two what have we done as organization to these employees to make them feel like they can't give their best effort we're evolving as a culture we're evolving as a people and the work place is evolving and we need to be ok with it because it's the same concept for me as people saying just because i didn't have it means you shouldn't have it too you should have to work hard just want to be careful about just saying that quiet quitting is te the you know the genses and the genis i think tht it can be happening all over the place and the more we stay engaged and connected and share our purpose the less of an issue disengagement will be and then hopefully the quiet quitting term will start fading to the background and we'll see both employees being productive and well engaged and employers being very successful new alarm bells ringing to night on the corona virus outbreak in this country doctors say the virusis spread through drop wits when someone coughs or seises i think the business community it's in their interest that people actually stay home and stop the spread for a business that can allow more employees to telecommute we want you to do that hey my name's lindsey jacobson i'm a senior producer with c m b c we've been working from home for about a week now and it's going ok i'm very lucky in that i have a separate space where i can work ah my partner a works at home full time so i've been invading his space a little bit a but so far so good i did some research on how the u s economy can perform while we're all dealing with the corono viris outbreak and how productive america the american work force can be while working remotely fifty to sixty per cent of the work force holds a job that is least partilly compatible with remote work as of twenty seventeen the u s bureau of labor statistics estimated the civilian labor work force at about a hundred and sixty million employees if fifty six per cent of those people are eligible for remote work that means over eighty nine million people could potentially work from home of course that leaves out forty four per cent of the american work force but does provide alternative opportunities for a lot of people for us the obvious choice was to really strongly encourage our employees to work from home in the technology is here now that enables remote working to be really really effective and productive while not all employees are eligible for remote work the emptying of offices and mass transit limits exposure for those who still need to go to the office like doctors cleaning staff police officers fire fighters gig workers and other service related professionals with the vaccine for covin nineteen still in the distant future u s companies are individually taking steps to enable their remote work forces it's been really interesting to see the spike in usage that has actually followed unfortunately followed the spread of corona viris with the corona virus pandemic shuddering offices nation wide can employers and employees adapt to a culture of remote work can the u s work from home with many states including washington new york and florida and the federal government declaring states of emergencies many companies are attempting to follow the trend of allowing remote work however tele commuting remote work and working from home which all entail similar experiences have been on the rise for a while there's a lot of different things it's called tele commuting remote working the future of work it's absolutely something that is gaining in momentumhe federal government has been required to every employee to work at home to the maximum extent possible since the year two thousand and one regular work at home has grown a hundred and seventy three per cent since two thousand five the drivers tend to change with the economy with whatever's going on in the world so during the recession it was about saving money and that's what  was driving sea eows to it now they found that if people were not in the building they didn't have to pay as much for real estate right now it's about attraction and retention of talent talent shortage and people want flexibility in some cases more than salary a this past week it has been continuity of operations and the corona vyrus whatover the course of the last really couple of years we have been moving to aor distributed work forse gallop state of the american work place study found that forty three per cent of employees work remotely with some frequency global work place analytics found that five million employees or three point six per cent of the work force works at home at least half of the time research indicates that during a five day work week working remotely for two to three days is the most productive that gives employees two to three days of meetings and interaction and collaboration with an opportunity to focus on just the work for the other two to three days of the week i think there's really four things that's driving it number one is frankly an increased focus on sustain ability people in the united states who wanted to work from home and that's about eighty per cent of the population say they'd like to do t at least some of the time a did twod at least two and a half days a week half time it would be the greenhouse gas equivalent of taking the entire new york state work force off the road permanently the other thing that it does is obviosly on the cost side and there's a lot of costs associated with business travel and so it helps companies address the cost but we've calculated that a typical company saves about eleven thousand dollars per half time telecommute or somebody that's doing it two and a half days a week  per year however not all companies agree that working remotely cuts costs cost savings has never been a driver for us to distribute our work for us if you reduce food service for example because not as many people are coming into the office a what i think that'll allow us to do is shift resources  to allowing more a more support for people and their home office set up where you might save costs from an office perspective i think if you're going to do it the right way you've got tor re invest in other things now there's another interesting thing a that the millennials are not the ones that are working at home but they're the ones that asked for it i would say the thingthat we've seen the last in two years would be a change in the work force itself almost demanding work place flexibility the ability to work where they want to work when they want to work that work place flexibility has also allowed for a more diversified talent pool at's been more about talent and flexibility and being able to attract and retain the right folks for us i'm so getting ond of spreading or our teams out not being as concentrated in san francisco for a number of reasons in part to tap into broader pools of talent m across the globe and not just have o know higher people who are only willing to work in san francisco new england and mid atlantic region employers are most likely to offer tel commuting options and full time employees are four times more likely to have remote work options than part time employees a typical remote worker is college educated at least forty five years old and earns an annual salary of fifty eight thousand dollars while working for a company with over a hundred employees a lot of people think it's the millennials a lot of people think it's mombs both of those are wrong it's about equal men and women but it is skewed at the older more experienced more tenured higher salary end of the spectrum actually it's a little bit polar theres there's there's this area at the very low end of the spectrum the low income call center agents that kind of thing and then the sort of senior managers there used to be a perception that only particular jobs are able to work from home because everyone was essentially coming back using applications that were sitting behind a firewall now a lot of our applications are available just through an internet connection in the cloud as businesses evaluate how to properly protect their employees from the recent covid nineteen outbreak many are basing their decisions on guidance from the centrs for disease control and prevention or c d c the c d c recommends sick employees stay home from work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met employers should also insure that sick leaf policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance the c d c recommends that employers not require a doctor's note for employees who are sick as health care provider offices may be extremely busy the c d c also recommends employers maintain flexible policies to allow employees to care for sick family members employees who come to work sick should be separated from other employees and sent home immediately the c d c is a previer public health agency and so it's important that they're able to do spread their recommendations appropriately we have to make it possible for people to follow those recommendations to help employees follow the guide lines for social distancing many companies are implementing their business continuity plans which incorporate a work from home policy companies like twitter are requesting all employees work from home the pupile just really thinking thoughtfully about how to get the same the same work done in a different way some companies are installing by weekly work from home policy in that case at least a portion of the work force has their exposure limited while work is still able to continue depending on an employees role companies are allowing remote work and testing its feasibility as we're actually doing a rolling shut down of offices around the world and testing stress testing if you will to make sure we are we have business continuity in place that we don't  cause disruptions for our customers oru employees remote work seems like a logical precaution for many companies that employ people in the digital economy however not all americans have access to the internet at home or work in industries that require inperson work according to the pew research centre roughly three quarters of american adults have broadban internet service at home however the study found that racial minorities older adults rural residents and people with lower levels of education and income are more likely to not have broadban service at home in addition one in five american adults only access the internet through their smart phone and do not have traditional broad ban access we did an analysis several years ago looking at the bureau of labor statistics data in terms of what industries have components of remote work now and t was virtually every industry sof construction agriculture etheres some component of many if not most jobs now that involve sitting in front of tha computer talking on the phone whatever certainly there are some industries that are leading te protect industry of course a health care might surprise you banking and finance however there are many jobs that simply cannot be performed outside of the office so allowing employees who can work remotely to do so protect those employees who need to commute the office for health care providers for educational schools hospitals municipalities and non profits dealing with cronoviris were actually giving away what we call emergency o remote work kits which enable those companies to stand up workers really quickly this means lognean like other organizations is offering its sofware services including vidio conferencing and it support free of charge to eligible groups during the corona virus pandemic other digital connecting sites like slack and skipe have always had free versions available this outbreak is testing the abilities of both software and broadband companies many people also do not enjoy working from their own home from their own couch they can find it hard to concentrate difficult to work in their home environment be easily distracted and have members of their family or neighbors not respect their time of course all these are heightened by the outbreak children have been kept home from schools and many employees agree to work from home without much notice or time to prepare we wouldn't have rolled it out in this accelerated pace we would have taken it in more of its year it approached a and ou kno wouldn't have rolled out for virtual onboarding for example until we had it ina in a e place where we thought it was in great shape or better shape that said am i do think this is just accelerating what the direction we were going anyway grown up ires is going to be a typic blank we plodded along at about ten per cent growth a year for the last ten yearsah but i i foresee that this is going to really accelerate the trend adapting to working remotely or from home can be an adjustment for both employees and managers i think one of the most important things is having a door having a place in your home where you can close the door lock out the kids lock out the dogs  ad and just concentrate you have to be comfortable for technology  you now knowing how to not just lot jus ou go to meeting or sky but you know all other tools because you're gon to be talking to people that are using different platforms ah and you can't let that scare you sothere always is that fear you know are you working are yu doing or you doing what you're supposed to be doing and so stay in touch with your boss angd your colleagues more you need to replace those those water cooler conversations with with greater rigor around management and engagement you have to force yourself to make sure that you're connecting with your team every day there's managers who are sceptical that are now starting to believe i think there there are employees that weren't sure that they could be productive or show up the right way if they were they were remote that now like that flexibility would want to continue it when you have this kind of environment when everybody is remote you feel like you're on this kind of level playing field we've actually seen companies have a sight leader for remote workers someone who represents the needs and expectations of remote workers to management if they're going to work hard in the office they're gongt  to work hard at home if they are going to slack off in an office they're gon to slack off at home y i don't think people fundamentally change who they are sof you men just because they're workg or home telecommuting all comes down to trust study after study academic or practical shows that they're more productive in fact they give back about sixty per cent of the time they would have otherwise spent commuting to go to working  in fack one of the biggest problems for people who work at home is turning it off at some point we will return to norma and once the country wide stress test of remote work is over some ccompany cultures may change to be more open to tell work i don't think we'll go back to the same way we used to operatir reallydo automnation is coming for your job at least that's the fear among many workers from burgher flipping bots to car building robots not to mention high powered software taking on more and more administrative tasks it seems like hundreds of skills are rapidly becoming obsolete in the u s economy a mackenzie study found that a i in deep learning could add as much as three point five trillion to five point eight trillion in annual value to companies eighty per cent or more of the jobs that make twenty dollars an hour or less are at least potentially subject to automation the economic shock of the pandemic hasn't helped human workers are vulnerable to diseases that robots aren't making it much easier and now cheaper to have a robot on staff that doesn't require health care bistes is u econd o working and seeing that humans can get sig from govered machines can you can eliminate e health care costs the laborand wage tag comes along with those folks particularly in services as aa big competitive manes to put the increase in robotis in perspective the u s had point four nine robots per thousand workers in nineteen ninety five which rose to one point seven nine robots per thousand workers in twenty seventeen but automation isn't just a robotic revolution the rise in information technology and artificial intelligence or a i has also become an ennabler of automation a i can help navigate difficult challenges that previously only a human operator could handle of course if you've encountered automated phone systems it's likely you personall experience that automation still has a long way to go there's nothing wrong with automation as long as it is part of a portfolio of technological changes but its specific effects are not super good for labor but the pace of technological change s accelerating and the cobe in nineteen pandemic could have acted as the accelerate the urban institute estimates more than eight million low income jobs have been lost during the pandemic whe o the reasons we have friction in our labor force it is that when people get laid off they have a hard time finding at a job and that's been especially true in the last twenty years high skill jobs such as finance managers pay roll managers and accounting rolls face a fifty six per cent chance of being automated in the future and according to consulting dot c a up to thirty per cent of oil and gas jobs could be lost to automation by twenty forty one major problem in the u s for workers is that workers are a tax burden for employers whereas machines are actually subsidized u s tax cot has been very ottomation friendly the united states has always taxed capital more likely than labor i think the government gon have to be more aggressive a going forward than jus sas they relyoa goa caa automation was progressing before the pandemic hit but the sudden financial pressure that businesses in the u s encountered created the perfect storm to turn to automation in previous recessions enterprises looking to stream line their business practices turned to automation and in some cases the recession simply sped up was already a long desired change the conventional wisdom about the pandemic is that it has greatly accelerated all kinds of trands ai artificial intelligence bot robotics and things like that the movement toward those is certainly going to be accelerated post pandemic for a simple reason robot still get sick in food service industries industrial machines that helped with food packaging preparation or even serving have helped to ease the burden on human employees who are susceptible to disease companies are looking to vaccinate their supply chains to make them more efficient automation of processes helps to eliminate the need for more administrative staff and a less human labor reliant warehouse system means that when a coworker calls in sick half the office isn't quarantined among those who are actually employed in some of these low wage occupations in the future there'ill be downward pressure on their wages right because they will be combeting with machines and so i think there there there will be some competition there if we're not able to retrain people for new things than the historical pattern has been that the people that benefit the most from automation are people that have i t skillsh in the post pan than the world if you don't have some it skills youare at greater risk of being disrupted and having your wages fall relative to other people both the trump administration and the bine campaign have proposals to advance job gainms for workers that have become effected at least in part by automation whether your predictions are true about automation and self driving trucks these folks aret stupid they listen they understand and they're scared to death the biden campaign is proposed making community college free and also providing money for apprenticeships but the trump administration has advocated more money for apprenticeships and so forth but i think as a society the need to help people transition to new jobs is going to be much greater in the post pandemic world than the one that existed just six months ago the key to a post pandemic world is a vaccine for covin nineteen recent vexing candidates have continued forward in clinical trials and there is hope that if the u s can feel the vexine quick enough the economic recovery could slow down some automation trendsthat of spite due to the outbreak but i don't think enough thought has been given to how to get enough people and i think it may take as many as eighty per cent enough people on the population to take the bacsine so that we can get her imunity and get our economy back to normal and then these trends that we're talking about the a i trends and and an automation they'll kick it later but we need to get back to norbal before we even get to the so called longer term treds the clock can't be turned back on technological advancement a i research is steadily increasing and us investment ranged between fifteen billion to twenty three billion and twenty sixteen alone in the long run better productivity leads the more economic growth leads to high wages for everybody so there's really no doubt in the long run automation the story of it for the past three hundred years has been a happy one in the short run for workers who are displaced we generally don't see wages recover has certainly not quickly we see more effects transmitted to their families as well wore poems finishing school or behavior issues according to deloit study fifty per cent of all jobs are potentially open to automation in the coming decades and according to mackenzie four hundred million workers could be replaced by atomation by twenty thirty which is about fifteen per cent of the global work force automation isn't all doom and gloom some are hopeful that if automation takes over lower skilled tasks it could open up opportunities for fewer work hours and more free time that could be focused on creative pursuits that could actually result in even more economic growth i certainly ways that the government can kind of step ind and actually support the reskilling of workers who've lost their jobs right on you know they can form public private partnerships support people going back to school or investing in mor specialized skill sets within industries help them move across industries from areas that have been hit hard by the pademic to sort of more merging areas so that's one set of policies the other set of policies is is to actually bod incentives o farmst actually do a lot of this work themselves well in general automation is important because it brings hihr productivity to workers om and it it allows us to do more at lower cost and so in general on average is going to be a great boon to us to challenge i think is during the transition both for individual workers in the communities in which they live you caul see some disruption from this particularly i think among lower income or less well trained workers who have fewer skills to transition in an automatic ar one proposal to help offset job lost from automation is the concept of universal basic income or u b i the freedom dividend makes the case to our fellow americans that we all have intrinsic value as people as citizens as human beings some u b i plans include a roughly one thousand dollar monthly payment to every adult in the country with no strings attached detractors have argued that u b i would cause a drop in economic activity because it would disincentivize work other arguments contend that it is not feasible financially for the u s government to dole out large sums of money to such an extreme number of citizens we dot sort of a temporary u b i ind the course of u ave pedemic a tat we set out the twelve hundred dollar check or as we talk now congress is debated whether to set out antother one i don't think that's perme legislatible from eficinal point of view finland recently ran a u b i study and concluded that it did not create a disincentive por sisizence to work the study compared two thousand people on u b i verse a hundred and seventy three thousand on unemployment benefits over a two year period people who were on u b i reported feeling better mentally about their well being compared to those on unemployment benefits researchers also noticed that those on u b i saw a higher increase in employment but remained unsure on the causes behind that trend i think handing out money to everyone regardless of their circumstances it's simply going to cost too much especially o in the light of all the additional debt that wehave taken onand we might get a better bank ro bup tan just you know giving out a checks every mon to people who haveint lost the jobs because there's also a no externality of facts associated with te rad most people i think on work they want to bill doing capitalnd thats bildeng op productive base quands of the future so it has a short termof static issued by during the pandemic gan fine wit having a short run sort of universal things again come because people can't work because he pandemic makes sense i'm not sureget ii don't think the evidence is quite ten that this isa very viable mong term strategy relatineto some of the other ways that weinget i besan that mony i think it's too late to reverse job losses from ultimation in the same way that it's too late to reverse the job losses that happen from say import competition from the low wage firms from china but we can be forward looking and have a better strategy for dealing with the continuation of this older workers appear generally less able to pit it into new careers that require learning new skills the challenge that we see isn't a twenty three year old learning new technology it's a forty three or fifty three year old part of the problem could be the way our educational system is designed i think a bigger challenge one that's going to be more love term though is to address educational issues erly on so that the ability to transition tasks for adult workers is really a matter of middle school math and language arts and so if you focus on those sorts of skills to make sure that te children don't go into their high school years unprepared i think you're really creating a class of workers that are better able to adjust new technology up to fourteen per cent of the global work force may be forced to change careers by twenty thirty because of automation  i'm an advocate of lifetime training accounts so that people could borrow and then pay back based on their income in order to get training certificats or certirficats to qualify the printe jobs and so forth and sixty six per cent of respondence to a mackenzie's survey of te executives said that addressing skeels gaps among workers was a top ten priority due to technological change right now ir tacnca sor to support the investments in capital riting and not labor and so iv weate you know put some policies on the books that actually provide firms instead of t actually investand labor rather than capital that might actually help as well the future of the american workeris far from written as automation grows political solutions could be used to stem the economic pain of a work force facing an uncertain future i think the focus was wrong ne the focus of the fear of automation should really be a focus on the educational deficits of a portion of our work force so we shouldn't be afraid of automation it's going to come whether ore not we like it we should embrace it the real public policy challenge is not to stop it  automation it's not to be worried about it it's to be worried about making sure that all the citizens of the country all of our work force every family has the skill to manoeuvre effectively in a world that's more automated or sees more productivity growth which affects labor command both trump and bomb administrations relied heavily on just having a growing economy absorbing new workers and eventually the tighter the labor market became wages started to go up because employers were bidding for them and i don't think tat there were a lot of superspecial efforts to accelerate the transition i think both administrations relied heavily on just a growing economy in general i don't think that's enough especially in the post andenti world we're going to need much more affirmative more active government assistance to get people into new jobs there is a notion that has developed over the last several decades that technology is an inevitable path that we're just following that path and anything else we try is futile and i think that's deeply mistaken and misleading technology is what we make it to be we have a technological problem platform and a knowledge accumulation and we can use these for creating different types of technology automation is just one of them altomating everything and making machines produce everything and sidelining humans is just one very peculiar path we don't have to follow that path that doesn't mean turning our back on a i doesn't mean turning our back on digital technologye but it means that looking forward we have to take ownership of the path of technolgy the pandemic changed how we work and while some companies are reverting to a pre pandemic work week eighty one per cent of executives say they are adopting a more flexible work place but getting employees to return to the office hasn't been easy you can't insist any more that employees come in for a five day week clive wilkinson is one of the architects being called on by the tex sector and others to help build work places that accommodate the changes of a post pandemic world they'll come in because they want to not because they 're told to or that they have to they'll come in because they want the benefits that the work place will give them people are going in to the office for different reasons than they were pre pandemic there's always going to be a need for the office it just might not be for everyone all day long the way it was pre pandemic wilkinson is no stranger to thinking outside the box he's designed and built offices for some of the biggest names in tik we were lucky enough to win the job to do the gogle headquarters back in two thousand and four the gogle plaks so gabran once walked into the meeting and said i would like a forest in the middle of the building and just as gogle and silkan valley influence common trends in the modern work place it is once again re inventing the office for high bred work we're in a different model where employes  be much more purposedriven a sit we're unwinding that idea of a worker being attached to a very specific spot of real estate we bein the company pracoved there was a lot of emphasis on individual space were werlepiviting that to make sure that we're building in more collaboration spaces with these changes employees are having a bigger say in what their offices look like we surveyed a lot of our employees about what they're looking for in the next ino collav offices suly important that  we understoodyou know what our employees wanted most in the next office and we built that into thesin the employees of the world are really having to listen to what makes a great work place it has to fill the gaps that work from home can't fill remote work introduce more flexibility to people's lives working from home saved an average of forty minutes daily from communing and seventy seven per cent of workers say they were more productive but the need for inperson business has remained unchanged there was a lot of benefit and a lot of goodness that came from working from home but there was a lot of things that were missing to o right people missed their colleagues an we don't have that spark of innovation from meeting someone face to face the tax in accounting sophor giant into it is one of clive wilkinson's clients and it is going all in on the high bred model employees come in between two to three days in person but that amount is up to each team on days where you might be doing a lot of individual work or headsdown work working from home may be the right answer but when teams need to come together to collaborate build that relationship to innovate and move faster we think those are what really will draw people back to the campuses wilkinson has designed two buildings for into it one was completed in twenty sixteen and the others expected to be finished next year did the first building with them a lot of kind of great collaboration space town hall space really a kind of well evolved a working environment we were about to repeat that more or less in a new building when the pandemic hit with the second project under construction during the pandemic wilkinson and his firm re designed the interior to reflect into its new high bred model the initial plans for intoit were very work station centric coming through the pandemic there was an acknowledgment that people are going to be working differently and so the architecture needs to change functionally to better suit the wide variety of new reasons why people are actually going into the office but we needed a kind of selectively er reconfigure that space and create environments like this library this more collaborateof hubs pive w w ane to review with you to day is the progress on the intoit blended neighborhoods so if you recall previously we had all work stations throughout the entire open office space and what we have moved forward towards is indicating certain locations for open collab in a time period where buildings have to be superflexible they have to be able to expand and contract we re design of this building this was actually an open office enviroment t it looked just like this that it was really silod and so we thought that this really lended itself to a quiet library programme but into it is asking that we really future prove this space and consider what this could be da to if they need to max out the building remove that library and then bring back those work stations i like how these different pieces can act as a testing grounds little bata testing a pieces and then they can see how that works over a period of time and adjust the rest of the building into its new office lay out revolve around regions it calls neighborhoods the neighborhood concept is one where you take an entire floor plate which can serve you know hundreds of people but then it's broken down into smaller compartments putting teams together but with a variety of space types some seated some conference room some bookable some non bookable but all in service to the way the groups are going to need to work especially in a hybrid world where not everybody may be there just come in and check im to the dusk it's surrounded by other support spaces so there's some two team rooms down at the end as well as different drop in rooms along the side and those are really for focus work so this is an example of what we're calling our library the concept was really to insure that our employees had choices particularly the engineers who needed some additional spaces to do the heads down and focus work this is an area that we've actually already set up and one of the things we know that we needed to incorporate is lockers vidio conferencing teck is everywhere helping bring remote and impersoned workers together i am talking to you to day from our mountain view campus mownviews our headquarters and we have upwards of a thousand da conferencing spaces on campus you consume has a couple of precepts the upgrated rooms that we're working on have tha what we call auto framing and we heard really loud from our employees that theyre they're concerned is they want to be seen and be able to be seen in the room whether they're joining virtually or in the room this is an example of one of the experiments that we're doing in collaboration spaces to really look at when people are coming back and they're not constantly looking at their lapop te visuals and the content that might be shared in as on call is close enough so that you can see it another one of wilkinson's clients is clab which is a social meteor creator teck company even though about half of our team s is an allinwe expecting them to come in to the new space yo now wante three times a week but and the majority of the team is going to continue to work remotely so it was really important that the new space that we design really works well for both in office team members and remote team members it has also taken learnings from hybred work to influence the design of its new headquarters in los angeles having employees come back to the office were competing with the comforts of home so we have to make the space really inviting and comfortable and enough fun to visit in thinking about an office for them it really wats all about visitors and the opportunities of having multiple settings for er photoops and shooting video and things like that we have a whole number of different collaboration settings and it's mostly around a collaboration and a little bit e proportionately about actual focus work by their their staff or their visitors these days of course zoomand novidio conferenci is a huge thing so you'll see multiple dotted around the place a little smaller zoome rooms but also morea collaborative larger ones so that bigger groups can actually connect digitly most of the furniture is reconfigurable all you've really got on these kind of sets and they do feel a little theatrical and they are intended as being a little theatrical and i do think also of a time they're going to be able to change and evolve those sets there's no work stations necessarily it's really open collapse space there's some enclosed meeting rooms and the idea is that it is truly just a call working space where creators can come in but also employees and they can work together it was about creating a space that the creators and the employees wanted to come to every day to see the workplace having to transform you know if you really just think of the big picture it's super exciting like we don't know what it's going to be like in five years time i personally find that incredibly exciting this is really a very simple equation make spaces that people want to be in and working and in a collaboratin we're starting to gain a deeper understanding of what people are looking for in their work places and what are the things that are missing about working from home that the office can fill in the gaps for and companies aren't just rethinking how to organize their physical offices we are definitely in discussion with clients about having a physical community and a digital community and devoting equal energy to the digital community the hope is that all these changes should empower workers and help make the office a better resource for productivity we found that our employees are just as productive if not more working from home i think the future is this this hybrid experience both in person and and wook there's just so many benefits to it people have more diversity and choice in where they work but we're missing some things about working in the office the way we were pre pandemic and as we move forward in design for the future let's not lose either of those let's take the best of both of those worlds and bring them together into the future we certainly were working on the lost model of a creative workplace and i think it's going to go to the next step and the next step mostly is going to be about empowering employees it's going to be making people's lives so much better", "summary": [" in august twenty twenty twenty one almost four point three million americans handed in their resignation . the resignation rate
