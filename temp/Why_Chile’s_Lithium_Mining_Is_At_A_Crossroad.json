{"text": "this is what lithium mining looks like in chilehere in the solar deatacama in a region of the world known as the lithium triangle nearly one third of the world's lithium is produced from brines so from this plant here how many electric vehicles are you powering to day about fifty thousand and we should be able to get up to seventy five thousand ev everything we're here with demands for electric vehicles and the lithiumon batteries that power them and at all time high chile's vast salt flats have become a vital national resource they contain the largest and some of the highest quality lithium reserves in the world this the solara athe coma represents the best lithium brines in the world because it has about two thousand parts per million of lithium concentrated in it this is also the most cost effective place to produce lithium in the world in the brine mining process extremely salty water from an underground reservoir is pumped to the surface and evaporated in large extravagantly colored ponds leaving high concentrations of lithium behind the demand for it is sky rocketing the price of it s sky rocketing and the capacity that chile has to exploit this resources is almost limitless but chile is actually losing market share to australia where lithium is mined from hard rock and argentina where the country is welcoming international investment many say that chile must act fast to rant production before other countries beat them to it or new battery teck is developed it's not clear how big a window of opportunity chile has to take advantage of this white gold now chile's president gabriel borrich has announced a long awaited state lead plan for the development of the country's lithium industry in which private companies will be required to partner with the government to further develop the country's vast resources lithium stock slumped on the news as many fear that the plan will deter private investment when you are asked to make the investment to take all the risks but without control of the profits and without control of the company that's not the way people used to do business but borrich has a lot of considerations to balance as the effect of brine mining on ego systems and water supply is a constant concern and open question as thereis just not enough research to fully understand is in taxs chile's indigenous communities though have traditionally opposed minding sacar and lithan te sesari but i lon beagoto e cain wot teeitta a sala  coma granaal devila butanata e coman cora son to de olian colena sava esupertitiale comassaan an watopicinomaicaante thetasian latete there are only two lithium companies operating in the country to day north carolina based albemarl the largest lithium producer in the world and s q m the second largest producer c n b c visited alba marl's lithium plant in the solar de atacama where we spoke with the company and community members alike about this pivotal moment in chile's history mining has helped drive the chilean economy for centuries the country is by far the largest copper producer in the world producing twenty nine per cent of the global total but as of late chile's lithium industry has taken centre stage in two thousand twenty two the exports of lithium were around seven point seven billion dollars which is more than eight times that exports that we had during two thousand twenty one that's not because chile is exporting that much more lithium but because the price of the metal rose so high last year here in the salt flats of northern chile near the border with argentina and bolivia lithium has been mined since the nineteen eighties before lithium iron batteries were even commercialized so in the eighties lithium was used primarily as used in greses to make the make the grease more viscous it's used in seramics it's used in glass its used as a medicine as well forfor by polar and for depression to day where the demand is really coming from is from electric vehicles your smart phone uses several grams of lithium an electric vehicle battery uses about sixty to eighty kilos of lithium extracting lithium from brines is a fairly straightforward but lengthy process first mineral rich brine is pumped to the surface once it's at the perfect point chemically speaking then will pump this brine from here over to pond fifteen which is the first pond of our fifteen ponds as the brine moves through all the ponds a variety of other salts precipitate out leaving behind increasingly large concentrations of lithium here at albamarl's silar plant it takes about eighteen months for the brine to reach six per cent lithium concentration after which the liquid is transported over one hundred and fifty miles bea truck to albamarl's processing facility in antipagasta which we also got the chance to visit typically we send between about twenty four and thirty trucks every single day here lithium is further purified into battery grade lithium carbonate which looks and feels just like powdered sugar chile was the largest producer of lithium until twenty seventeen when it seated the top spot to australia where the country has acted quickly to ramp up production in twenty twenty two australia produced about forty seven per cent of global lithium supply while chile produce about thirty per cent now some people are even talking about argentina taking away the second position that chila has now as the world's second largest producer of lithium because argentina has all these projects in the pipe line while argentina has thrown open its doors to foreign investment chile has not though the country is typically viewed as one of the most nea liberal freemarket economies in the region lithium and chile is heavily regulated that's because former dictator augusto pinoche categorized it as a strategic resource in nineteen seventy nine due to its use in nuclear weapons allowing the government to restrict its extraction albamarl and s c m partnerd with cor folk the chilean economic development agency to develop lithian resources while the chilean nuclear energy commission oversees quotas and exports up until now companies could theoretically apply for a special license to mine on their own but this has never been granted and no new lithiam mines have been opened in decades albemarl and s c m are the only games in town those companies pay high taxes and royalties they have to sell a certain amount of what they produce domestically at below market rates to subsidize other industries that may develop that use this resource so it's a very heavy hand of the state and a great reluctance to allow other players to enter the sector we're paying the highest commission in the world totract lithium here in the slard ata kama so twenty twenty two a we will have paid the chilean government over six hundred million dollars in commission though many in the business community aren't exactly thrilled by president borch's new plan for a state controlled lithium industry the new framer will likely provide private players with more opportunity to enter the market and explore resources beyond t atakama and has existed in decades past it's helpful that it looks like chile will be welcoming new investment in the slithium sector and that it is now formerly in favor of new projects and we haven't seen new projects in a very long time despite the massive reserves of lithium that chile has in that sense it's a positive development the new long delayed national lithium policy represents a compromise of sorts between the two wings of president borch's governing coalition which is divided among lectists who hope to see full nationalization of the industry and a more freemarket wing they wanted to see private industry take the lead nostrosafio ecinostobais setam forme en el principal proto de litermund amentandoet manera suricesa i saro diprivendola hutament al mimotiem pociprotecem la veriversia de losalar borce himself is a lectist who took office last year at thirty seven he's one of the world's youngest leaders an environmental and climate issues were central to his campaign the plan he presented calls for the creation of a chilean national lithiam company which will partner with all private companies looking to enter the sector a lot of people referred to it as a nationalization of the resources i don't think that's quite true but certainly it's a bigger role for the chilean government than the private sector would like the chilean government to play crew says that the initial impression was that the state would take a majority share in these public private partnerships but the administration has since walked that back the ministry explained that when they're talking about control it's not necessariy to own fifty per cent or more of the company that they're arways to have control like or shareholders agreements and and so on we were also explained that this control is only in those projects that the government will define as strategic project so it's not something that will be for old the joint ventor e for the xplatation of nat what exactly constitutes a strategic project remains to be seen the new policy does honor the existing mining contracts that albemarl and s cuam have with the government though which expire in twenty forty three and twenty thirty respectively but forge says that he plans to negotiate with the two companies for the state to take a stake in their operations before their contracts expire s c m is reportedly set to begin talks with the government in the next few months and is investing two billion into sustainable technologies to meet the new plans environmental goals the company did not respond to requests for comment albemarl said in a statement that we expect no material impact as the chilian government made clear it will fully respect existing contracts the company said they will continue to collaborate with the government moving forward and when we spoke with leni pasanu in january she said that albemarl supports the public private partnership weare incredibly supportive  of the chilean government's aspirations to develop thisis national lithium company we're also quite interested in partnering with thim because of course we've got more than forty years experience here and certainly know how to work with brinds the new policy won't go into effect immediately first it has to be approved in congress where borich has struggled to pass legislation his party doesn't have a majority and congress recently shot down his major tax reform bill that blow came on the heels of chilean voter's overwhelming rejection of a progressive new constitution last year chile's mining minister acknowledges that it will take years to get the national lithium company up and running so in the meantime two existing state owne companies will be in charge of handling all new lithium contracts copper giant codelco and minerals company anami borge also wants chile to move beyond just lithium extraction and invest in downstream processing for the battery supply chain they do not merely want to export the natural resource which has been the economic history of latin america chinese e v giant b y d plans to build a two hundred ninety million dollar cathod manufacturing facility in antipagosta and corpo has given the company preferential prices on lithium carbonate the input used to make cathod material but some analysts think that it's too soon for chile to move into downstream production given that the e v industry in the country is practically non existent we didn't see a single electric car when we were there in ten or fifteen years when there's battery plants all over the world it'll make an more well developed supply tin and e vs everywhere ill make sense to be making batteries on every continent right now it doesn't chile's raw lithium is of great strategic importance to the u s though which has a free trade agreement with chile but not argentina the u s has determined that it needs to have the domestic battery and electric vehicle industry and it's not going to have one unless it gets access to plentiful supplies of affordable lithium and right now its best bet is to get the lithium in places like chile unfortunately for the united states it's not the only country that's realized that and the chinese are investing heavily in places like argentina and chile to get their hands on lithium to produce their own batteries and electric vehicles and so this great power competition between the united states and china is really playing out in the lithium sector in chila zantacoma desert right now as we speak and chile's new policy could end ut being favorable to the chinese as cruse expects that the country's state owned companies will be some of the first new entrance into this market it's not a secret for anybody that many chines state on companies are interested believe you and probably e they will be the first to jump in because when you have an state own company wi economy like the china they are not looking for having medat profits they are more patient but as with so many mining projects domestic and abroad calls for rapid expansion often drown out the voices of local and indigenous community members who are wary of the environmental and social impacts of mining on their ancestral lands and way of life in chila aticamenios also called licananta are an indigenous people whose history in the attacama region dates back to around five hundred b c

locals believe that bri mining in the atacoma desert is exasperating the problem albemaro emphasizes that brine is different from fresh water since it's too salty to either drink or to use in agriculture yet many remain concerned that evaporating so much brine in one of the driest areas on earth is having an impact on fresh water availability and the surrounding ego system so where talking about i don't know iss an immense  millions of flates of water that evaporate every day and that's half an effect i mean we cannot say that have any effect when en in spite of the of the water cycle so it is it's impossible to say that have any effect wha directly how is something that hase to be a thing on de understand am and research en more in response albemar points to a study led by researches at the university of massachusetts amherst which concludes that the entire lithium mining process in the solar de atacama accounts for less than ten per cent of fresh water usage in the region and that evaporating brine does not lead to diminishing reserves of fresh water either on the surface or underground the study was funded by b m w which is ramping up its electric vehicle production and b a s f a european chemicals company raising questions of conflict of interest for some but what everyone agrees on is that more research is needed and the new lithium policy includes the creation of a public research institute for lithium and salt flats that could dig into questions like these as a microbial acologist dador also studies how mining is impacting the verse microbiology of the region her research indicates that lithia mining has led to the death of micro organisms that are key for scientific research and vital to the broader ego system if we are thinking about life we have to include everything ad microbel life are the dominant type of lit in the planet because everything is related from this perspective she doesn't see borch's plan for a state lead lithium strategy as relevant to her concerns because the point is we are still pushing the tactivism as the main way to develop economy for most people i think ther very affect when they see picture from theamason howthete forestation haf increased i now at it really cares o ow happen borrige says that strengthening social and environmental sustain ability is a priority for the administration

la communiaes kiro compometers ki primerito te process comesera cuna compersasion direct in telconseco po atacamen imibrson there are no easy answers when it comes to balancing the various interests it play and though borrige has laid out a general strategy for the country's lithium industry much remains to be seen how big a role will mining play in the future of chile's economy how will it balance social environmental considerations including water use how much will it demand that the lithium produced in chile as well as the copper is used domestically for green energy industries verses sent abroad to be industrialized in countries like the united states or in places in europe these are tough decisions and their policy decisions and i think right now chile is still struggling with what kind of economy it wants to have many are still anxiously awaiting more specifics on the national lithium strategy and how much control the state will actually exert  they listen to details the main problem here is that we are losing time we were waiting for some policy with answers and not something this blurry that is only creating  more questions and time is short chila has a small window of opportunity which is wat ten years fifteen years that's because as battery ercytling technologies improve less lithium attensive battery chemistries are explored and other countries ramp up production the need to vastly expand lithium mining in chile will not last of course that's welcome news to the many that view the mines as an unwelcome intrusion simpre sona e cegre losenti ficosce esaroalbo cesa mecorca lit decarnos trancil in the meantime though companies like albemarl and s q m are working to maximie efficiency at their existing plants the fastest way that you can make significant change is by what we call sweating the assets right so we' double the capacity of our conversion facility in antipagasta that we've built the solar we're completing a construction of the solar yield improvement project which will allow us to increase production by by thirty per cent and lenti pasanio is looking forward to a promising but commercially unproven technology called direct lithium extraction or dely which chiles mining ministers said will be required for all new lithium mining projects with this chec lithium is chemically separated from the brine and that brine is then reinjected back into the earth expediting production increasing the amount of lithium recovered and reducing environmental impacts some claim that what now takes eighteen months with evaporation ponds could be done in a matter of days with dele this process could actually use more fresh water though which has albemarle looking towards desalination and so as part of this new era of lithium we're working with the same company that's going to bring the disolidated water to or lanegra chemical conversion facility to bring a desalinated water pipe line here into the salar and that's going to allow us to change technologies there's a lot on the line and a lot to consider as the company and the country at large prepare for a new era in the chilean lithium industry i think chile is trying to find a middle ground here there are countries that do want to control every aspect of this industry there are others like argentina taking real hands off pro market approach i think chileis trying to protect the environment protect local communities be a player in the industry while still attracting investment and making sure there's enough private money around so that the industry can expand rapidly to meet demand it's not clear it will succeed but i think that's a fairly reasonable logical approach", "summary": [" chile's vast salt flats contain the largest and highest quality lithium
