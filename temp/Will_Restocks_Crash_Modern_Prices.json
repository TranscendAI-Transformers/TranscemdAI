{"text": "what is going on all you pokermon collected maniacs out there this is ryan the pek pek papa and to day we're going to be looking at some restock data o k so listen we all know brilliant stars lost origin brilliant stars was on the way to a two hundred dollar box that was all the way up over a hundred eighty bucks nd then a little restock was announced and we saw the price come back down now lost origin was doing the same thing these are two scets that we all think are goingto be two of the biggest in the sort in shield aera lost origin was all the way up over a hundred d seventy bux a small restock was announced and guess what the re stock hasn't even hit yet it's supposed to hit the middle of next month yet we're already starting to see the impact on it so i thought why don't we do this why don't we take a deep dive into what brilliant stars did we can layer it into what lost origin did and also this is a great spot for us to go ahead and gather some data because it's going to happen again right this is part of what happens in the pokemont collecting and investing space we see all kinds of restocks happen from time to time and it's good for us to understand how it affects current sets tha way we can layer it in when it happens in the future so listen if that kind of stuff excites you we're going to be looking at booster boxes a leat trainer boxes pokumon center exclusively trainer boxes were to be looking at the top five singles for both of these awesome sets in this vidio and if you like that listen hit that subscribed button we're building an amazing community we'd love you to be a part of it if you like what you see give us the thumbs up questions or come ands drop em down below i love interacting with you guys now with that being said let's dive into these two awesome sets and see what has happened since these restocks were announced now as i said both of em were on their way up almost to a hundred eighty hundred ninety dollars brilliant stars was over one eighty small reprint restock whatever you want to call it was announce and it dropped back down to m s r p we've seen the same thing with lost origin and as i said this restock hasn't even theoretically happened yet riht so crazy but here's the thing i'm to go into a little collector investor theory before we start looking at the rest of the tata so for me it's very interesting that they announce a restock when it's currently not out of stock on the pokemon center right so it's kind of hard to restock something that's not out of stock but my thought is this it's probably out of stock in all your local card shops pokemon is probably having a problem moving it through the pokymon center at the velocity ta which they want right they would prefer to sell it on the pokymon center ecause think about it they get all the money ah but if they can't sell it they want to move the product and they know that there's demand because the price is going up so they probably decide to reallocate a lot of what theyalready have i don't think this is a reprint right like brilliant stars is only twelve months old lost origin is only nine months old i don't think tat they turn the printing presses back on i think they're reallicating some of the inventory that they already have and they're moving it into the local card shops now for me that's an important piece of the puzzle because if there's not an additional influx of more cards being printed then these sets are going to do what they were destined to do all time now pokemon doesn't want to send im to local card shops i'm not saying they're they're against it by any means but again when you send it to a local card shop you got to sell it at wholesale and then the local card shop has to pay it or sell it at a premium in order to make some money pokemon would much rather sell it on the pokemon center but probably what happened was they have these run rates it's just not sell im as fast as they thought so they said hey we got to get the product off the shelves let's send it back out to these local card shops collectors win investors win a pokemon company wins the card shops wins it is a win for everybody so this is a good deal right here now the reason i think this is also a a restock instead of a reprint is i think we sometimes underestimate the amount of product that the pokemon company has just sitting in warehouses right great example the other day in the discord somebody mentioned hey listen there's a restock on x y evolutions booster boxes on or not booster boxeslee trainer boxes on the pokemon center web site so gess what everybody had the discord piled in there and sure enough there were there was champion's path there was x y evolutions le trainer boxes there was all kinds of old product on there now of course peco pica popa missed out as most of us did but the reality is it was restocked now they didn't turn the printing presses back on they didn't print this product they just had it in stock probably what happened was a paldea evolved isn't selling at the rate that they hoped they're probably going to be i don't know maybe fifty thousand dollars short of their sales budget for this month so the guys in the sales department sat back in theire like you know what i know what to do let's pop some popcorn ets put some of this old product on the pokemon center let's watch the fireworks and then we'll hit our sales goal for the month and that's what happened right they probably needed fifty thousand dollars worth of sales they put fifty thousand dollars with a product up and it's sold out immediately and a that's just when i say haylisson tere's a differnce between reprint and re stock and i simply think that these two products are being restocked and now everybody who was freaking out thinking they might not be able to get this product they were going to the secondary market even though it's available in the pokymont center remember not everybody has access to the pokymon center so a lot of people had to go to the secondary market in order to buy these products but now that we know it's being restocked in lost origin it has come back down to m s r p just as brilliant stars has now i think this is really interesting that that's where they settled ah brilliant stars has been there for a couple months now and now i think lost origin i don't see lost origin dropping much below m s r p you can see after the announcement there was that little big drop and now it's even starting to tail up just a little bit a so itw'll be interesting to see whith the influx of product into the market a where this ends up in the long run but i do think that seeing where brilliant stars was and how in a very short amount of time it's already back to m s r p i think that boads well for lost origin so if you can get it under m s r p whatever that might be there might be upside and this is why we look at older sets that went through a a similar process and compare em to the new ones so with that out of the way liston i committed to going through the top five cards of each of these sets and that's what were going to do now and i think it's important to understand that the way single market performs is differet than the way the sealed market performs so let's take a look at that we're of course going to start off with the two big chase cards and both set we got the chars r v ald art we got the guaratine of v ald art these are the big dogs now the chars ar v ald artless and even with that little restock at the end of the day the trend line has not changed it has continued down nd to the right i mean this is in the high one thirties now which is i think an amazing price on an amazing piece of cardboard especially if you have this strong conviction that brilliant stars is going to be one of the best sets in the sword and shield ara then i think getting the best card from one of the best sets in the sword and shield ara at a hundred and thirty bucks i think itis a great deal now the guiratina on the other hand is starting ad come down a little bit you will see though even prior to this announcement of the re stock you see that it had flattened out maybe in the singles market we won't see the full effect until the restock actually happens but it's interesting to see that it was flat flat flat flat flat it was announced and then it started to come down just a little bit far from a crash far from a huge trend line a change but it certainly has come down just a little bit and this card has been on a fricking freight train locomotive mission a since the end of the year right like we knew that we looked at all the top cards from twenty twenty two and how they performed thus far this was the only card that was up double digits out of all the top ten cards from twenty twenty two so this card was doing really really well and it's interesting to see it flatten out a little bit so now let'slook at the number two cards right this char ard v star i think it's absolutely beautiful i love this card so much again this is another one where we just see the trajectory seems to be unchanged right it started really aggressively down into the right which we expect from new sets we always see that we've certainly seen that in scarlet and violet and paldea evolved even though paldea involved has a couple cards that are bucking the trend and are going up actually which is very very interesting a but charz ar v star right here com ind down trend hasn't changed if anything it's starting to flatten out a little bit again i'm going to say it like if you think this is one of the big sets this is oneof the big chaise cards at sub seventy dollars i think that's an absolute steel for the future this charzard card is really great but again this is about the restocks and the impact and it certainly doesn't seem to have any here same thing with the aradact we will have to keep an eye on it but it's been essentially flat ah for the last i don't know six months so not a lot of movement and i we haven't seen any big movements in it since the announcement it'll be interesting to see again if we get more product in market if it's going to change anything but my biggest thing is this if you love this card and if for whatever reason when those booster boxes hit your local card shops if this does drop in price it might be a cool opportunity because in my mind and i don't know anybody pokemon company this isn't confirmed this is just my my theory as a business person right is that i believe that this is just the reallication of current stock i don't think this is an additional reprint so one way or the other this product was going to hit the market whether it's now or later so keep an eye on that in this lost origin space here we go ver lokgat the number three chase cards this arcius is the first time we seen one when after the brilliant stars was announced it actually crashed came down big time hasn't shown any sign of slowing down it's got a weight ond its angle and its sink into the bottom of the ocean right now well that change i don't know was that directly in effect because that brilliant star is restock i don't know that either one out of three is not enough for us to say that it was caused by that but it is interesting to see that the top two cards fared the same and now we're startn gat in number threewere gon tolook at nuber four weren to lok at number five and we see some impact here at number three so something to keep an eye on right here then we got the rhotum v all art right there again it doesn't seem to be any kind of price change on that it's ong to be interesting to see how some of these lost origin number three number four number five cards a perform because as we start talking about n wer going to see that they don't have a lot of the big the art is beautiful but they on't have a lot of the big name power right like number three and brilliant stars is archios number three and lost origin is a rhotum v right like there' there's ere's a fundamental difference we know arc us v is one of the top grade tod poke em on every single month in and out so we know it's got the name power but it'll be nteresting to see how these cards perform with the upcoming a restocks now again two big names right here in the number four slot this umbryon card is just absolutely awesome but it did the same thing the archeus did right now we're starting to see a trend outside of the top too number three and number four saw a big price drop after that restock was announced the difference between the archius and the umbryon is umbryons like listen this is the sword and shield era i'm the big dog of this era i'm going to bounce right back up which it did so really exciting to see that yes this one came down but it also has that tip up here so that might be interesting when we look at the number four card for lost origin which is another big name pokemon right like this pekachu vemax which is just another stunning frickan piece of cardboard so if this happens to go through any kind of big drop it might have the wherewithal it might have the name power the star power to do the big bounce just like this umbrian did right here so it could be really really interesting to keep an eye on it but as i'v right now pikachus like i'm pekachu i'm the big dog i don't care he could care less it is doing the exact same thing no big change in the trend line so now we're to get to the number five think hat this is a really cool for me this ultra ball he i pulled this as a family we pulled it not long ago i i know maybe four or five months ago and sometimes i submit cards to p s a simply because we pull him as a family and i want hi capsilated because it's just a memory and i want to keep it forever like i know i talk a lot about the investing side of things but this is so much about my family and the enjoyment that we get from the hobby together so i sent this though to p s a to get great and it's actually on its way actually it is back i just got to get it in the mail a so anyways long story excited to have this and the prices just an go in nuts up into the right so really cool to see that this card again even with the re stock it just didn't care the trend line is the same up into the right this card is doing really really well a lot of people are excited about it so it's interesting to see this card a on this bull trend and this bull train as been going on since december right so it's not like this was effected by rotation or anything was announceda months after december it has been on an awesome awesome bull run ever since december and then you know we got right here the galarian per circerr here i don't know i don't know that what th future of this car is i mean it is an absolutely awesome piece of art work it's stunning i love it i think this is a frieking awesome awesome card but it's been on this downward and the right trajectory does it have the wherewithal does it have the name power does it have the studliness to stay at number five in this big set that is lost origin i don't know but again we haven't seen any trend change in this card ever since the announcement of the re stock so now that we're through the top five and both sats we're going to get into the elite trainer boxes and again we were just talking about booster box restocks like it has nothing to do with the elite trainer boxes but i did think this would be interesting for us to talk about because at the end of the day these contain packs packs are being  redistributed into the market so it was interesting for me to see what happened now the bottom two grafts those or the pokymon center exclusive e t bs look nothing is changed with those right they're still in the low sixties even though you can buy em on the pokumon center right now for forty nine ninety nine absolutely crazy but anyways it doesn't matter they're still in the low sixties not a lot of change you know you actually see the brilliant stars one i's been on an upward in the right trajectory ever since  that restock was announced which is interesting so maybe people dvalued the booster box once the booster box was announced they thoght hay thers going to be more of these in the market and maybe they piled into the pocumon center exclusive e t b because they thought hay there's more exclusivety in this you certainly know the peka peka popo thinks that when you're buying these pokumon senter exclusive e t bs that's what you're buying you're buying exclusivety right you don't have to worry about the restocks quite as much so interesting to see that lost origin p c e t b is still doing the exact same thing then when we get to the regular le trainer boxes on the top you'll see not a whole lot right in february a brilliant stars was flat flat flat it dropped recently its starting to tail up a little bit and then lost origin nothing changed tran line is actuay up into the right so really exciting to see these le trainer boxes doing what they're doing so hay listen i thought this was a cool vidio right like i absolutely know lost origin hasn't even hit the market yet but i wanted to take a look at brilliant stars i wanted to see where lost origin is right now that way we at least have a point in time to monitor and we can see three four five months from now where these sets perform and if this had any real meaningful impact on them because listen who knows silver tempest chilling rain like tere's a lot of sets that could be reprinted restocked whatever youwat to call it here in the future and i want to make sure the whirl plan chess when evrybody else is playing checkers and we are ready to pounce so with that being said i hope you guys have an epic day if you made it to the vividio and you haven't it that subscribed butnt yet what are you doing it that subscribed but and if you like what you saw gives the thumbs up questions or coments drop em down below i appreciate you and i'll talk to you soon thanks everybody", "summary": [" the pokermon collected maniacs out there this is ryan the pek pek papa and to day
