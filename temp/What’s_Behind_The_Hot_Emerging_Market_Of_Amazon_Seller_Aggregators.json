{"text": "the clients of this exclusive los vegas party come from a different world than you might expect the third party merchants who sell on amazon and the companies wooing them aggregators have rapidly become one of the hottest segments of the start up world more than sixty amazon aggregators have popped up in the last couple of years raising billions in big funding rounds to buy up small and medium businesses that sell on amazon usually aggregators take a brand over buying out the entra panure who started it sometimes for millions then they use large scale software and marketing solutions to try to boost the brand sales in july aggregators flocked to the sixth annual prosper show in los vegas looking to entice new acquisitions at the popular conference for amazon sellers people giving a way a tessla just  talk on the commissions if you're able to bring in a deal to be onest   it the talk of the town i think if i grisine from college to day and have a pik shuld i go to amazon or an aggregator it would be maybe more likely to go to an aggregator just because they have they're doing all the things that you did at amazon to be able to grow these cellers really quickly we went to the show floor to ask aggregators sellers and former amazon insiders what's behind all this hype why now and whether the fad will last by day the westgate los vegas filled up with thousands of amazon sellers listening to presentations on how to succeed on the crowded market place tes asi o iss by night aggregators throw exclusive after parties one sent cigar boxes to sellers hotel rooms with secret keys to hidden bars another served lobster oysters and caviar another sent employees to wander the floor and hand out fliers advertising a free tesla model y to any one who refers a seller it ends up buying this is a big change from the last in person prosper show in twenty nineteen when the amazon aggregator market was in its infancy attendance this year was up ten per cent from twenty nineteen and several of the biggest aggregators thracio hayday and perch paid to have exhibitor space at the show what's happening with the market place right now is very much about similar to that transition that went from brick and mortar to directinsuver brand so it's where consumers are amazon says its store has nearly two million small and medium sized sellars generating more than twenty five billion dollars in profits in twenty twenty and accounting for more than half the products sold amazon says third party sales are growing faster than its own retail sales so it's no surprise the number of aggregators is booming too there are now at least sixty nine amazon aggregation companies based in at least a dozen countries with a collective seven billion dollars in capital raised just since april last year milissa burdick spent ten years at amazon before starting in e commerce advertising software business which is now used by some aggregators it's all about how to i move the fiwill as fast as possible and bern these brands question is at of all sixty of these i can they all survive and micro brands have been taking share for a long time i think it's getting to this tipping point where it's it's as a whole very big but it's amazing to me how proctor and gamble unever these big companies  with lots of dollars to spend are losing share to these small aunch borners aggregators give venture capitalists a foothold in the mommon pop world of amazon sellers in exchange the sellers get to cash out and their brands get access to far more resources it's not unlike the age old model of giants like proctor and gamble gobbling up smaller companies then using financial prowess to dominate prime space on grocery shelves and t v ads lots perch and thracio are two of the biggest amazon aggregators having scale gives you better access to capital technology talent different market places different channels of geographies we are sometimes taking brands that you know maybe don't have that git of images or daggatof product packaging or you know we're able to improve product quality you know so slightly so that we can improve our revew rating aggregators tend to keep the original brand name and the loyal customers that come with it growing that customer base and profits using their larger marketing and data power we're not the next general mills or johnson and johnson or procter and gamble we don't believe that the brands we own need to be brought to you by heyday these are brands that have stood on their own for a long time they've generated very loyal customers repeat rates they've done a fantastic job getting from zero to one and it's our job to get them for one to five or ten or whatever the number is to do this aggregators develop software to streamline the intricacies of juggling dozens or even hundreds of brands a big part of how uncaers hustle and how they go about their otheir path to success as they monitor their listings hourly and they're constantly watching competitors and we can do all that with technology and alon times this technology doesn't make sense for a solounchponor to build but it could make sense for us to build it does make sense for us to build as we can we can demploy it across hundreds of rands in a statement amazon told c m b c the aggregator trend is an exciting opportunity for sellers that want liquidity and to exit the business for a new adventure tho sal with mea sowing a fish more for sure hang out with my wife more some of the aggregators are buying talent and amazon knowledge and giving them jobs et cetera but some of them are holding them on others are just buying it outright giving them a big check and saying enjoy your time on the beach for the next six months even relatively smaller players are raising big bucks like a quico which raised more than a hundred and sixty five million enough to commit to giving away ten million dollars worth of teslas for referrals meanwhile thrasio and perch have reached unicorn status but all this hype is very new when i first went out to fun rays for perchs is a difficult idea to fund raise for a lot of investors were worried about amazon channel risks a lot of investives pushed me to go make a soper solution instead of actually buying the brands former wayfare executive criss bell founded perch in twenty nineteen now it's raised nine hundred million dollars and has more than seventy brands under its umbrella so why did the trend take off now so i think there's a confluence of amazons market place becoming more a mature and kind of hardening if you will around the edges to make it more trusted and then the pandemic and i think just a lot of people noticing that this was possible and coming after it founded in twenty eighteen thracio was an even earlier leader in the space by twenty twenty one c m b c ranked thracio twenty second on its disruptor fifty list and it's now raised one point seven five billion whenever a new asset class is born and someone reaches a unicorn status of a billion dollars there's a flood into that market even now still think that there's a lot of growth in change in in how the amason eco is book somi on the seller side casey goss joined thrasio in april twenty twenty as the one hundred and twenty sixth employee now it's got at least nine hundred and thirty employees just in the u s therants were acquiring they don't have experts and literally ou know every indof field that we're able to from messo to copy writing and creative and so we're able to put all these brands through this checklas and make sure of that were we're optimizing them far better than the average seller can thrasio runs each brand it acquires through a five hundred d three point migration process to figure out needs like better keywords images or influenceer marketing one success story is a pet odor eliminator named angry orange we were able to completely revant the branding behind angry orange we had snoop dog you know do some some cameos for whatever but th the brain is absolutely killing a angry oage is the fastas gor pet protu when thrasio bought angry orange for one point four million in twenty eighteen the four year old brand was making more than two million dollars in t annual revenue thrasio says that's now up eight times to sixteen point five million thrasios now acquired a hundred and twenty five brands i think it's hard to like get a home run on all one twenty and that's probably ther theory which is out of one twenty even if we get eighty per cent or sixty per cent it's ok it's really a kind of a numbers game another aggregator strategy is to keep the number of acquisitions small hayday has acquired sixteen brands far fewer than thracios one twenty five and purchase seventy haydays raised more than two hundred and fifty million simply because you have a lot of reviews doesn't necessarily at least in our mind mean you're going to be around for a very long time chas woodward who joined hayday after several years as an investment banker says each sellar acquisition had revenue over one million and the potential to grow ten times larger we're not looking to acquire a hundred brands we're looking to take our brands and ten exno we think attractive statistic is ability to identify underwrite acquire and then truly drive growth and improvement to the brands that already exist do you have the eyeballs and the expert teeth to really grow those brands organically over time or do they they start to fall off some sellers like stacy renfro are trying out the model on an even smaller scale her brand m design did more than two hundred and fifty million dollars in sales last year primarily on amazon it recently acquired its first sellar wild birds of joy we do a lot in plastics and bins and their company was primarily focused on bird feeders and humming bird feeders and things like that so pressive was a great way to start expanding our assortment more into the outdoors renfro says m design is also the target of bigger aggregators that keep trying to acquire her brand there's so much happening in thi space that i think to be conservative to say that once a week someone reaches out to us is probably being very modest ha ha ha ha ha aggregators even those going for a big number of acquisitions admit that selling on amazon is tricky having the technology and the process in the people to enable us to be a thousand and ten thousand and then a hundred thousand of these really really well is big and is hard this is not an easy business to run as all these sellers know one of the notoriously difficult things about the celler business is that amazon constantly changes its rules fees and protocols something that aggregators say they can help navigate most of these brands are run by it's a solo perneer one onchperner nd there's a lot of components to selling on amazon and as amazon has continued to grow and competition has become more sophisticated the sheer number of things that you need to do in order to survive let alone thrive and be successful as an amazon seller continues to increase and become rather difficult amazons af bohemith so to say that we're on speda with them would be overstating the case but as you have scale as you are doing more business on the platform i do think amazon will lean in and understand that they can make the life easier for folks like us amazon charges merchants between eight and fifteen per cent per sale plus a variety of other fees that have gone up significantly during the pandemic in june fulfilled by amazon fees went up an average of four point four per cent and cost per click ad sales are up fifty per cent year over year with the rise of aggregators who have far deeper pockets than individual sellers the cost of doing business on amazon is likely to rise even more if you're a long time amazon seller and you're doing a million dollars a year and youve been working really hard for a long time you have an opportunity now for a real exit so on that side it's good my other concern from the celler side community is are the costs of amazon going to rise even more because there's nearly forty amazon aggregators that have raised a hundred million dollars or more and i think sadly that the answer to that is probably yes amazon told c m b c that it spent more than eighteen billion dollars last year on ways to help sellers grow including logistics programmes people and two hundred and twenty five new tools and services geared toward sellers there're so so many negative things that everybody wants to say about rigt the big about amazon but you know something that is really nice about them as they do embrace the smaller third party celler and the amount and the volume that continues to come from the smaller cellers continues to grow as for whether the aggregator boom will last amazon told c m b c in a statement we expect the majority of sellers and brands will remain independent and continue to use our store for its scale and reach but for now as the trend continues it's changing the fabric of what it means to sell on the world's biggest e commerce site and beyond ve there've been rumors that thracia is going to go public this year and so i think there's going to be a handful of public companies called aggregators and they were born buying up and aggregating these great sellers in these great brands whether the t c continues to attract to it that's a question because it's still such a new market that it meads to pay off i think we can be a multi billion dollar revenue company and a publicly traded company that is has a bunch of household names that people know and trust that are everywhere you want to buy not just on line not just on amazon but through all the channels"}
