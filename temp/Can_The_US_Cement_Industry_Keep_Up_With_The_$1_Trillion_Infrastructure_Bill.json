{"text": "concrete is the foundation of just about everything concrete is responsible for modern civilization i mean to be blund you walk on a concrete sidewalk e mark lat at te state on the specelaperpad con when you travel your aircraft lands on a concrete runway drinking water is provided through concrete pipes not to mention what we know as concrete jungles cities in fact concrete is so popular that it's the most widely used man made product on earth for every person in the world about three tons of concrete gets used every year then a very durable sustainable resilient material for thousands of years after all it was essentially concrete that built rome those thousands of years ago to make concrete we need cement first the two materials are iherently tied together but they're entirely different products but this essential construction material has fell victim to pockets of shortages across the u s the cement itself is becoming ore more difficult to get we're not unlike many industries covit cause disruptions in supply now demand is expected to increase the global cement market could be worth over four hundred fifty eight billion dollars in twenty twenty eight as more millennials buy their first homes and after the senate passed a major one trillion dollar int structure package i believe it's a historic investment of roads and rail and transit and bridges all of which need a ton of concrete we don't have tho workers ingredients capacity to deal with the demand by nont just command f the five per cent at the same time this kind of production emits a significant amount of carbon dioxide one study estimates that global cement production accounts for eight per cent of global c o two omissions that makes it the largest single industrial emitter of carbon dioxide here's how the cement concrete supply chain works and whether it can handle the demand from the new one trillion dollar intstructure spending plan demand for concrete rises along with construction activity in twenty nineteen seventy per cent to seventy five per cent of u s cement sales were to ready mixed concrete producers which was worth at least sixty five billion dollars first it's important we point out the difference between cement and concrete cement is like the egg of the concrete recipe so concrete is produced when cement makes a paste with water and thats joined with rock and sand to heart so concrete is moref a value an the product there are many different recipes for cement but the most common one is for portland cementbut there're different types of cements one that's cheapest to make and is most prevalent is gray portland cement call portland because it's named after the gray stone on the isle of portland england the first step to making portland cement is getting all the ingredients or raw materials mainly rocks or primary ingredients calcium silica alumina and iron these are the most common elements in the earth's cos calcium is the main ingredient calcium carbonate a a limestone the process of making cement is still the same to day   you have to get raw material you've got to get raw material from a quarry cement companies own quarry space where they use explosives to break apart the earth to find the right minerals needed this quarry here is part of lehi cements operations in union bridge maryland it's expected to have about eighty to one hundred years worth of limestone all the raw materials get crushed together intoa powder and then after it's ground and crushed they put it ina rotary kiln that kiln heats up to typically about twenty seven twenty eight hundred degrees fahrenheit and by the way that's about a quarter of the surface temperature of the sun so it's really really hot and because it's so hot we have these really complex chemical reactions that are taking place after the crushed rock cooks in the kiln it turns into material calld clinker then the clinker gets ground up again into a powder this time materials like gypsum are added into the mixture and then they become cement the process is still the same well it's pretty much the same the u s cement industry has a rich history american industry shows the impossible o complex almost overnight the world's largest cement in rise these early u s cement manufacturers helped build the holland tunnel the empire state building rockefellow centre andpate mokao ea a project that changed global trade as we know it to day now cement production occurs in thirty seven states making the industry super local which is part of the supply chain problem now when the corona virus pandemic struck in twenty twenty u s economy came to an abrupt halt the cement industry wanted to prepare for the coming recession the last recession after the two thousand eight financial crisis caught the industry off guard tike they expected to have big shutdowns because of what happened ten twelve years ago two thousand eight two thousand nine all of us expected the same thing to happen to man fall off a cliff and that didn't occur this affected supply levels which is why the industry isn't seeing cement volumes at normally wood right now causing that supply tightness in local markets across the u s sullivan says the cement market still grew by two per cent over all ind twenty twenty and a lot of that growth came at the very end of the year like lehi cement and union bridge they're sold out for at least the rest of the year another pandemic issue the ongoing labor shortage such a process just to lay a concrete slad that's human beings and there's not enough of them to do that kind of work and the hotter the market the greater the increas ing prices it's hard to find truck drivers who move the product around locally we rely upon trucks to deliver the sement from the plant to our termes i think ninety seven per cent of all our product flows by trucks the red hot housing market in the u s during the pandemic increased demand for concrete instances in which supply is unable to keep up with demand what at leads to is betting works tha people are competed for concrete slaps lay foundations and that raises the price of those kinds of things a not just for foundation building but also for things like patios and driveways and so on in sulphur s so lots demand out there supply cinins ruptions higher prices big inflation numbers frustrated home wiers plus weather events and siberd tacks can shut down production another reason the industry sees delays these current supply chain canks will work out in the coming months if economies continue to reopen at the same pace and as if now it's predicted that the u s has the capacity to manufacture the cement it needs assuming imports of chemicals and ingredients arrive on time drivers and laborers are hired and that extreme weather events don't shut down production and that there aren't any covid related shut downs of course that demand will increase even further thanks to the intra structure deal we have ample capacity to meet even the most robust introstructione you've got to identify what projects you can identify the supplies of those projects youve got to do bids revus it takes time but you also have to look at it with carbon omissions what happens to the life cycle of that product pas has it producedhas used what happens when it is cement production also comes at an environmental cost there is some positie correlation between economic activity and our greenhouse gas forpri to the extent that demand is higher the industry is more active ouill tend to see more carbon reduced in the earth but we're looking at carbon neutrality throughout our entire value chain d and reaching that by the year twenty fifty our value chain isn't just cement or concrete or for that matter what happens at a cement pant from a material sience standpoint that concrete absorbs c o two now it's not a game changer but right now we estimate about ten per cent of the c o two omitted during the manufacture of cement and concrete is actually reabsorbed through the life span of a concrete structure and when a concrete structure is demolished we can reuse that aggregate for new concrete the prospect of more climate friendly cement has attracted big name investors break through energy ventures which is backed by bill gates jeff bazos richard branson and other high profile investors recently invested two point five million uros in egosam materials to roll out new formulations of environmentally friendly cement i think its going to be to issues one is drink in everything that surrounds it on the product side as well as on the production side in the second one it is the interstructure even without the pandemic driven labor shortage the industry needs to train more workers to make up for retirements in the already shrinking labor pool s an economist who want to see a larger uessaconomy a more efficient u s economy one that has more interestrustre available to its people its frustrating to see so few young americans in particular enter the skell of trade and that's again one of the reasons that we have these shortages of interest tructure these very high price as so in the long term i suspect we will have enough sument but in the short term we continue to have the supply chain difficulties particularly in certain markets and so the prices arerising and so right now apparently supply is not rising up to meet themand the capacity is not i still think that well man  be face shortages and high prices through the bawalce of the year but if youl tart to see more a better equilibrium form over the course of this year and then into next year", "summary": [" concrete is the foundation of just about everything concrete is responsible for modern
