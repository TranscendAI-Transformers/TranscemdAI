{"text": "this is a plant and quarry owned by the largest road paver in america c r h in twenty twenty two it made thirty two point seven billion dollars from this quarry comes the rock that will become this there are about two point eight million miles of roads in the united states companies like c r h are newly flush with billions from the u s government the largest buyer of asphalt in the country if you look quearly at the dollars youd say it's the golden age of themfor structure the magnitude of the investment one point two trillion dollars of the next five years of fifty per cent increase from the federal standpoint but there are some strings attached more money is going to projects that prove they are better for the environment the companies have the technology but implementing it is not so easy there's one thing to say ha let's use this recycled material this is great it's a wind wind until you look at it you go yet but the performance is going to be lousy of the nearly three million roads in the u s ninety four per cent are surfaced with asphalt asphalt is a mixture of aggregate and a petroleum based binder the small percentage of surfaces not paved with asphalt are made of concrete a more rigid material that is better for vertical structures bridges over passes even buildings its rigidity makes it more prone to cracking when concrete needs to be replaced the whole structure needs to be removed asphalt on the other hand is more flexible it is applied in layers a crew can re surface an asphalt road by shaving off and replacing the top layer and more importantly a piece of a road a single lane on a freeway can be ripped up and replaced without disturbing the rest so what ar you looking at here so this is o broken up asphalt depending on where you are even to have something different so asphalt isn't just the same everywhere now it really we no about thirty per cent of america's urban roads are in poor condition they carry seventy per cent of the three point two trillion miles driven annually in the country and the reason for that is there is more and heavier traffic than ever a twenty nineteen report from the transportation research board requested by congress showed that much of the country's interstate highway system is built on foundations that are fifty to sixty years old paving over aging foundations is producing diminishing returns most of the system would need to be reconstructed from the ground up and that would require nearly doubling the investment in the long term to make those improvements if you took every lane mile owned by texton you could drive around the earth's circumference eight times almost two hundred thousand lane miles of roadway that doesn't include county roads and city streets and so if you think about the scale of the network that we have it's huge and so financing that wert network and maintaining it is a really big deal at the federal level most of the money to repair roads comes from the highway trust fund which historically has been funded mostly through taxes on gasoline and deasel those taxes haven't been raised in decades the fund has had to rely on transfers from general federal revenues to stay afloat every few years it is not on a regular schedule congress passes big bills to authorize spending on highways and transportation hence the intra structure investment and jobs act signed into law in november twenty twenty one it was a historic investment set to boost federal highway spending by fifty per cent over five years the magnitude is what's really significant here when we look at the magnitude of that opportunity we're encouraged because i think we play in the markets where much of that dollar will flow the byden administration has made combating climate change a top priority purchasing materials that can demonstrate lower carbon omissions throughout their life cycle is an integral part of that among other things the industry is touting asphalts ninety five per cent recyclobility rate it's made investments in substances like warm mix asphalt which can be made at lower temperatures therefore reducing carbon emissions at plants and on roads these technologies companies say are positioning the industry to take advantage of this new era in interstructure spending sixty five per cent of the asphalt industries business comes from publicly funded contracts most of those are for highways there is a small share for air strips the remainder of the industries business is commercial and residential about half of public contracts are federally funded the other half are state and local contracts range in size dramatically in twenty twenty one the federal government spent fifty billion dollars on federal aid highways which include interstate highways and other highways and roads these make up about a quarter of all the roads in the united states roughly sixty per cent of that money goes toward pavements in twenty twenty two that rose to seventy billion because of the interstructure investment and jobs act the intrastructure bill passed by congress and signed by president byden in twenty twenty one the consolidated appropriations act passed in late twenty twenty two added another seventy billion dollars federal funding for road and bridge construction is expected to total three hundred sixty billion dollars over the five years from the date the bill was signed into law in november twenty twenty one through twenty twenty six this facility belongs to tilcon an asphalt company in the northeast united states it is a subsidiary of one of the largest asphalt companies in the world c r h c r h sells a lot of other building materials too somewhat unusual among competitors the company also builds with what it sells at one point we sold asphalt and aggregated radim concrete now to our eand customers we sell a road andd maintain that surface which is a big evolution for the business of the thirty two point seven billion dollars c r h made in twenty twenty two twenty point five billion dollars came from north america you have a company which has been generating particularly of the last number of years very attractive returns on the astas tat ere operating they have shown very strong levels of marg in resindance particularly as the cost back drop has been quite volitied its road paving business made up half of its north american revenue that business has eight hundred thirty locations across forty one states and two in canada construction is a fifty mile rateus round any one of our plants it's the weight of the product itself heavy construction materials only travel so far otherwise it become economically unbuiable so it's important to have a network of plants and reserves in k strategic areas as of may twenty sixth share prices had increased by twenty five per cent since the beginning of twenty twenty three a shareholder who bought the stock when the group was formed would have an annual return of fourteen point eight per cent they'd have a bit less if they'd bought it in twenty thirteen a group of u s piers to set a slightly higher overall return in that time but c r h has out performed global peers wi on a lot of analysis on the returns onrvested capital they generate a premium to therest of thefactor wek think that those returns are defensible we think that they can re invest the axess capitallat they generating the business into expounding the business in twenty twenty three it plans to distribute nine hundred sixty billion dollars in dividends and repurchase nearly two point six billion dollars in shares combining these figures implies three point five billion dollars in shareholder returns equivalent to about nine per cent of c r h's existing enterprise value the average of its construction materials peers was three per cent last year and the dividend yield on u s piers is lower i think the stock performance has been good overtime my particular view would be that there isn't enough appreciation of the quality of the assets that they have orla of how differentiated the proposition is on how much value theyre delivering to customersa we also have a load out screen which we control all three scales for the trucks that we ask to common and we pretty much tell tem what silo to go to for the product that they 're asking for c r h's business is vulnerable to the construction industries cyclical ups and downs a few factors lessen this almost a quarter of revenue is intro structure related over the past twenty five years u s introstructure spending has had about a third of the volatility as the residential construction market c r h also has what some analists say to be the largest aggregates reserves in the u s because aggregates are hard to mine and ship that business has proven stable over time being a supplier and builder at once also can protect it what that brings in terms of benefit to larger contracts and more complex interstructure projects is the ability to ordinarily reduce project times reduce costs they can incorporate sustain ability into a project and of course ultimately it is tot value that the delivering to their customers which gives us the confidence to say that the margins are generaing the returns are generating should have a good runway into the future and might even improve thereafter the company is currently listed on the london stock exchange but will be moving to the new york stock exchange on or around september twenty fifth twenty twenty three we think that will enable more scaling of this differentiated strategy and it will enable them to enhance their organic growth prospects which have always been quite attractive but at the moment there aren't any real chinks in the armor money from the interstructure investment and jobs act is flowing in about half of it is going to maintenance projects and the other half is going to build new roads we are bidding on those jobs day we've secured work and our back logs would be up versus last year which is encouraging to see as states really tackle some of the most challenging interstructure projects that we have because it operates in several sectors c r h expects to benefit from the three hundred seventy billion dollar inflation reduction act which supports domestic energy production and manufacturing the company sees an opportunity to provide concrete for wind turbines and utilities there is also the two hundred eighty billion dollar chips and science act intended to increase u s semi conductor capacity and foster regional high teck tubs the bump in domestic manufacturing and onshoring produced plans for about thirty mega projects each worth more than one billion dollars in twenty twenty two that confluence of money having really provides a unique opportunity of werbidding and actually executing on projects with that money t while the overall outlook appears quite bullish there are challenges first the i i j a might not be helping as much as it seems while it has boosted funding by about fifty per cent inflation has driven up highway construction costs by nearly thirty per cent gets a challenge for our customer and so if we're customer focused becomes a challenge for us as well two tools c r h says it can use to reduce contract costs design and circularity so i think that's what's very important especially an infer structure to work early on in the construction design phases to really find out exactly the needs of that specific project when you build a road not any road is the same requires different aggregate different asphalt different longevity in terms of the outcome of that roadway so working early on can help mitigate the kind of cost inflation c r h says recycled pavements can lower costs at the moment about twenty five per cent of every mile of pavement it lays down is made of recycled materials that's a benefit to the taxpayer it keeps the cost down in terms of the overall a product for ourselves but also more importantly for our customers that allows a state department of transportation to take on more projects than they would typically do because of that leading focus on sustained ability and circularity recycled asphalt pavement or rap is what it sounds like asphalt that has been pulled up off the road ground up and used again more than ninety five per cent of existing asphalt is recycled but nation wide only about twenty per cent of the new roads laid down are made of recycled asphalt that is an average some states use much more michigan allows up to fifty per cent and c r h has test projects in aggregate poor florida which are using up to seventy per cent the industry is trying to increase the allowable share of recycled asphalt to fifty per cent as of twenty twenty three many states cap the percentage of recycled asphalt in any given mix primarily overfears it won't perform as well as virgin pavement again one of asphalts strength is that it's flexible ind can hold heavy loads without cracking as easily as concrete the ideal asphalt mixture is one that flexes just enough without cracking and without forming the kinds of ruts you might see on an old unrepaired road but asphalt ages in the field and when it does it gets stiffer when rap was first introduced in the nineteen eighties there were failures those experiences have contributed to the caps i'm not saying that we have it completely figured out but we're a lot farther along than we were fifteen years ago and i think you're going to start to see the performance of a lot of your pavements improve because of that and improve with a more recycle footprint in them asphalt laboratories often at universities are exploring a wide range of research this includes testing different mixes of aggregate to see how well they perform over the long term they are exploring higher performing binders and testing both recycled asphalt as well as other materials such as ground up tires or recycle plastics one of our biggest challenges comes in how do we take what we learn in the lab and predict what's going to happen in the field because in the field you're building it under traffic you're building it with heavy equipment that you know spans out twenty foot wide youre you're rolling it with seven foot wide rollers it's cooling at different temperatures right so what happens in the lab and what happens in the field two very different things and so tonner research going into what do our test in the lab tell us about what's going to happen in the field so that we can make better decisions on what materials to put into our mixes to get the type of performance we want and researches like gorganis say one of the best sustainability in long term cost saving measures is building roads that last longer how do we rebuild these roadways under traffic in such a way that we'll get another sixty years out of because there's not a light switch you can't just turn these roadways off people use em commerce uses them how are we going to rebuild these things under traffic how ar were going to do it fast without sacrificing quality it's a huge challenge",
