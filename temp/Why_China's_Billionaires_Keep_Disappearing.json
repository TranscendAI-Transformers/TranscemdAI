banker who went missing in february however a few days later his company said he was co operating in an investigation being carried out by certain authorities in the people's republic of china when someone like balfant disappears some one that high profile who suddenly vanishes without explanation that inevitably sends a chilling feel through the rest of the market how can you feel like you can do business in a place where an important leader of industry can suddenly disappear we've seen a string of disappearances of high profile business figures going back literally years it seems like we can't go too long without another high profile figure being disappeared china has nine hundred sixty nine millionaires that makes it home to the highest number of millionaires by country china a communist country dethroned the u s a capitalist country from the list in twenty sixteen shijin ping's nation remains poised to overtake the u s as the world's largest economy the main reason why china has so many billionares is that in the era of opening and reform and the economic miracle that ensued over the past decades china's market has brought great opportunities to a smart ontrpreners that really made the best use of all the new fields of technology and economic engagement opening up but not just with china's domestic market but also of course internationally for most of the twentieth century china was one of the world's poorest countries after world war two ended a civil war broke out between the chinese communist party and the nationalist party ar quoman tong the communist party's victory marked the rise of mausa dang who declared the creation of the people's republic of china on october first nineteen forty nine during the nineteen fifties mal implemented a five year plan dubbed the great leap forward to improve the country's economy the key features of this plan included forced agricultural collectivization and rural industrialization the plan backfired triggering one of the largest famines in human history china's fate changed after dung jaw ping became the defacta leader of china in nineteen seventy eight ra so if you look at the policies under dung saw ping that was an era of  policy experimentation particularly with this idea of the free market dung came into power after you know a long period of time in china when the economy was very much state driven resources were sentrally allocated but under dung chaw ping there was a movement towards letting the market play a greater role in resource applocation and this allowed antrepreniership to flourish it allowed china to cultivate commercial opportunities for the rest of the world which really brought a lot of development and wealth and prosperity to the country he famously said let some people become rich first and then those who become rich first were go down and gett the rest of the chinese people becoming rich when president she came to power in twenty twelve he was still friendly to the enteponer class in china because he understood tivat secrtorywas the engine of the chinese economy uayan she slowly started showing his true feeling toward millionaire onto renewers in twenty fifteen gogwan chang who was known as chinas warren buffet when missing the company later said he was assisting authorities with an investigation according to a source he was spirted out of that hotel in twenty seventeen shau jani a chinese canadian millionaire was abducted by chinese security agents from hong kong in twenty twenty two he was sentenced to thirteen years in prison for fraud and corruption in twenty twenty billionaire real estate tycoon renji chung disappeared after he called president she a clown in an essay over his handling of the pandemic the same year he was sentenced to eighteen years in prison on corruption charges well these are just a few well known names on the list one name that grabbed the world's attention was the disappearance of jack ma founder of ali baba in twenty twenty i think it's probably several pieces the rapid demise of jack ma clearly one part of it was the growing strength of ali baba his company and particularly an financial his financial services company i think it was felt that it was becoming too powerful in terms ofa controlling the data of the chinese people information and the lives of chinese people it was also clearly becoming a rival to a big state enterprises and specifically the state own banking system jack ma did not help things by his sometimes brash outspoken personality he directly criticized the state own banking sector he described them as having what he called a pon shop mentality and that really ruffled a lot of feathers so i think it was really a combination of things real concern about the growth of ali baba it becoming a rival to the state on banking system and also the rash character of jack ma rubbed a lot of regulators and very powerful people in china the wrong way don't forget that the rise of jackma actually has a lot to do with the chinese communist party under the rule of government because before anni baba went i p o i believe hi's two thousand fourteen at new york stock exchange the key money that he received was from china u masm corporation which is a china soveren was fun actually so from that perspective e common sense is that you don't bite the hand that fidio ma who's known for his grandiose public presence has kept a low profile ever since the episode unfolded co founder jack ma has returned to mainland i recently spotted at the yingoo school in hong jo the city where ali baba is headquarters most of the last year in japan the matic downfall of jackma house  you is that you knw in china no matter how rich you are no matter how famous you are if you on against the comist party or even if you are perceived to be critical of the comister partyi can punish you because the country has no human race even for the very rich onfim famous jack ma's episode was also the start of the so called te crackdown in china where regulators targeted te giants like ten cent bi d j d dot com bi dance d d and others china experts like dexter roberts author of the myth of chinese capitalism believe the chinese communist party viewed these tek giants as too powerful and influential i have referred to the checin ping era as party in command era or the politics in command economic era so cheaching ping has made it very clear and hes pursued this goal of strengthening the role of the party throughout china so i think he used the phrase east west north south the party rules it all and all this really signals a new era where the party has far more control over the economyt large but also particularly over private business so the question of you know should private investors bes fearful of seg bing i think everyone r now is holding their breath it's really hard to overstate the degree to which marked confidence was affected by the policy developments over the past couple of years china sometimes disappears its billionaires to send a message to industry it might be a signal that something is coming whether that's another industry rectification campaign or a tightening in a certain regular sort of space on march tenth shijan ping started his historic third term as chinas president since the president's term limits were lifted in twenty eighteen she is basically president for life his primary focus right now is to strengthen the slowing chinese economy the second largest in the world bajing's strict zero covet policy choked the country's financial health slumping its economic growth to three per cent in twenty twenty two from eight point one per cent back in twenty twenty one it was the second slowest year for growth since nineteen seventy six in twenty twenty the growth fell to two point four per cent well i think china's had a very rough three years during the pandamic the economy has been doing very badly i think there's an awareness at the top of the chinese communist party they need private investors they need foreign investors to try to rebuild the tattered chinese economy but i do think that this is unlikely to be a long term trend this market friendly attitude i think is happening because china needs to be market friendly right now i do think longer term it's much more likely we will see a reimposition of stronger political control by the chinese communist party and that's bound to be bad for business both foreign and contrapenurs this idea that private and foreign investors aren't exactly sure what's coming down the line that's really going to cast a shadow over china's economic prospects not just in twenty twenty three but perhaps rest the twenty twenties as well a shijin ping learly intends to stay around for a very long time he sees himself as the uncontested ruler of china anyone who challenges his power or the party's power is going to be in his cross hairs and unfortunately that's what our private antrapaners have experienced recently as we've seen with the disappearance of balfan and others i think this trand is going to continue the chinese consto party over all is going to be more and more repressive over the chinese society and the shijing pin is going to have more and more power within the chinese const party the series of disappearances of hi propil billionares in china is really a stark reminder that this is a fundamentally different political system and that rule of law despite the fact that the chinese government regularly says it has established to in china juest really means something different there", "summary": [" china has nine hundred sixty nine millionaires that makes it home to the highest number of
