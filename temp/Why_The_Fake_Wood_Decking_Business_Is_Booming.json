{"text": "during the covid nineteen pendemic americans stuck at home started to take a hard look at their surroundings and that has led to a home improvement boom furniture retailers pool companies and others have seen demand sore and share prices rise pool and staller latham sat its sales for the first quarter of twenty twenty one or up one hundred ninety one per cent year over year high and home goods and design company r h said its revenue for the first quarter of twenty twenty one was up seventy eight per cent it was down nineteen per cent a year ago and many customers are also deciding it is time to build a deck sky rocketing demand combined with historically high lumber prices led to very good fortune for a couple of publicly traded companies that make a rather humble sounding product fake wood decks strictly speaking these are composite decks and polamer decks composite decks are typically made of plastic often with wood fibre and sawdust mixed in polamer or p v c decks are pretty similar but made entirely from plastic they typically have two layers a core made of plastic sometimes combined with wood flour or sawdust and a cap that seals the product and achieves the look that simulates wood two of the biggest names in this space are trecks and aze together they control about seventy five per cent of the composite decking market which is in turn about twenty per cent of the entire eight billion dollar decking market a third brand fibron has about ten per cent share wood alternative deck makers say their products often look nearly identical to wood and last for decades much longer than a typical wood deck they are also building themselves as an ecuo friendly option treks product is made almost entirely from cycled materials and asek has been working to boost its products recycled content both are commonly available brands that were growing sales even prior to the pandemic due to growth in the housing market and aging housing stock and an increased interest in alternatives to wood which may look great but can cost more money and energy to maintain over its lifetime and both asek and treks say there is room to grow so do some of the contractors who install decks both wood and wood alternatives but these materials are expensive and they are not without their drawbacks how much share can these players grab how many people would pay for a fake wood deck the total decking market is growing at a rate of about six per cent per year composite decking has been growing at a rate closer to ten per cent per year and some companies are doing better than that trecks is the market leader with about fifty per cent whereas the treck company has grown at about sixteen per cent average over the last five years a mostly because of our actions on converting wood into composite buyers and bringing more attention to the industry making sure that we're educating those consumers that there are affordable products that wire perform for twenty five years bus on their deck rather than installing wood which will probably have to be replaced between ten and fifteen years at the hi trecs started in nineteen eighty eight when a business man named roger wittenberg blended sawdust with recycle plastic to make a park bench the company started producing composite decking in nineteen ninety three trecks then went public in nineteen ninety nine its sales have roughly doubled in five years from four hundred forty point eight million in twenty fifteen to eight hundred eighty point eight million in twenty twenty over the same time net income has grown from forty eight point one million dollars in twenty fifteen to one hundred seventy five point six million in twenty twenty in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty trexs sales grew thirty nine per cent over the same quarter in twenty nineteen that is notable because the final quarter of the year is when winter and the holiday season are setting in and construction tends to slow down by mid july of twenty twenty one the company shares had risen more than seven hundred per cent in the past five years asak is second in the industry and markets itself as a more premium product line it was founded in nineteen eighty three as a manufacture of plastic sheet products for commercial and industrial applications it later expanded into low maintenance high performance residential building products azac branded trim came out in nineteen ninety nine and ducking and railing followed in the two thousands timber teck its main ducking brand was founded in nineteen ninety seven and bought by azak then called c p g in twenty twelve azaac went public in june o twenty twenty and its sales have grown from six hundred thirty two point six million in twenty seventeen to eight hundred ninety nine point three million in twenty twenty but the company has been losing money it had a net loss of twenty point two million ind twenty nineteen and a loss of one hundred twenty two point two million ind twenty twenty in each of the categories that we play it's really important for us that if we have technology that gives you a better aesthetic and allows youto have more designed flexibility and so we tend to be the the visual leader we have more we have more types of products and and in each of the categories we're differentiated that way our outdoor living business which includes decking really over the last ten years has had a fourteen per cent gill prig and so really independent of which window you look at whether it's five years or ten years we've seen really really strong growth you know for the category especially a coming into the pandemic nevertheless asec shares have risen since the company's i p o both trecks and asec make use of recycled materials ninety five per cent of what goes into trek's decking comes from rcycled materials the company buys wood and secures recycle poleetheline mostly from plastic bags wrap and canisters from its roughly thirty two thousand collection stations at stores and distribution centers across the united states and canada it converts this into ducking through a process it closely guards most organizations most manufacturing they want a very clean very consistent stream coming into the front part of the manufacturing line and i'll give you a consistent product at the end of the line we do the opposite we get a highly variable raw material stream coming in the beginning of the line and will give you a highly consistent highly valuable product at the end of the line asex says it uses up to eighty per cent recycled content in its capped composite decking and approximately fifty per cent recycled content in its capped polimer decking it's investing and raising the recycled material content of its product for example the company recently bought a p v c rcycling facilitythere are a few reasons why demand for these lumber alternatives is growing the first is an increased interest in outdoor living a trend that has been growing for years but that accelerated during the covid nineteen pandemic the american institute of architect's annual home design trends survey shows that interest in outdoor living has been extremely popular in recent years in its most recent survey in the first quarter of twenty twenty one architects saw a dramatic uptic in spending on outdoor living space over a year earlier about seventy four per cent of architects surveyed reported requests from clients related to outdoor living spaces that is about a twenty per cent jump over the same quarter in twenty twenty the uptick is notable in part because outdoor space improvements have been popular among clients for years in addition the millennial generation is beginning to move out to the suburbs and seek home ownership the second reason is long term cost effectiveness versus wood the price of composite decking is generally quite a bit higher than a similar wood product trek estimates that composite decking will have a starting cost of thirty dollars per square foot including installation whereas lumber recent dramatic price swings notwithstanding starts at about half that trek has tried to peg the price of its product at no more than twice the cost of lumber these companies say wood alternatives won't need the same amount of maintenance no stripping sanding or refinishing and are far more resistant to fading both azak and trek say their composit or p v c products will last decades at the same time covid related demand spiked lumber prices began to sky rocket they shot up two hundred seventy five per cent during the pandemic before finally backing off in may of twenty twenty one there were two things that we needed to do to increase that conversion first was have a product that sold for two times the price of woodi didn't have to be right at the price of wood but two times the price of wood where was about a six hundred dollar up charge for the average deck that was where the consumer is able to say oo k i can afford that that makes sense and once the consumer sees that they could do that they're actually willing to move up to a higher level of the stanic as well while wood has a natural charm to it many customers are not terribly thrilled with the maintenance even before the pandemic composite decking was still winning converts o composite boards and with stand years of sun and snow and won't fade rot or become tarmit when comparing composits wers of wood there's really no competition which material is better over the twenty five years lifetime of a composite deck the maintenance saving person wood is in the thousands of dollars the third reason for rising interest is aesthetics using composites in p v c allows for a wide variety of looks for example asaac has several collections with different names like vintage and harvest that give clues as to what kind of wood the material is mimicking we've got an ability now with newer technologies that you can really design the environment you want whether that's you know wood look a more modern look and in many cases andand in our case almost all cases it's really indistinguishable from from the natural equivalent with the one exception of it's going to look the same for thirty to fifty years and it uses  recycle materials an its construct eric perkins is a contractor in north carolina who also has a u tube channel with his brother called perkins brothers builders he has been sponsored by trecks in the past but currently has no such relationship with any decking company ow some of the alder products really look like plastic decking they are like gray speckly looking boardsandnd all the companies have done a great job to really make it look more realistic make it look more like wood grain and the multi colored of a you know wood natural wood would look a you are going to pay a price for that and so some people are willing to do that they the clients that we've had have really loved it and ah but it's one of those things that you know doi want nicer cabinets or do  want a nicer looking deck finish for a deck that gets a lot of sunlight a compositor p v c deck will resist fading but composite decks also get pretty hot since the material is so dense p v c does not get as hot but it will be more expnsive and has its own limitations if you have a dark color so you know by everywhere if you an gett  trecks or other composite decking and you can put it in direct sunlight and you live in mississippi you might want to think about getting the lightest color possible obviously they 'll stay a little cooler the companies in this space think composites can take a lot of share away from wood they already have in other categories in siding for example wood only commands a thirteen per cent market share fibre cement vinal p v c and other materials have all but taken over that segment of the market treks has been betting on continued growth for some time in june twenty nineteenth the company announced a multi year capital investment plan worth two hundred million dollars at the time executives said the plan was a response to faster than expected conversions from lumber to composite decking as part of the plan trex built a new two hundred thousand square foot factory the new building which opened in january twenty twenty one is part of the two hundred million dollar plan designed to achieve a seventy per cent increase in decking capacity trek also made upgrades to production facilities in nevada wood accounts for about seventy eight per cent of the overall market place and trex especially thinks it can steal more of a share from lumber there are about sixty million decks in the united states and about half of them are thought to be passed their useful life while azac also wants to grow its decking business it is also thinking of how it can cluster decking products within a larger outdoor product portfolio we think that that this category is going to continue to expand we deal with porches which is the front of the house as people look at the back yard it's not just deck people are doing much more on surfaces you know i mention patios there's just a lot of opportunity as people focus more and more outside ah you know for companies like us as as we continue to invest not only the decking side of the business but the stuff around the outside of the house tt that provide that sustainable low maintenance beauty both companies are leaning into sustain ability in recycling in part because both believe social responsibility is a high priority for a lot of customers to day especially younger ones just as trek has been the pioneer in the composite decking category it is also led in the use of recycled materials in twenty twenty it used three hundred sixty two million pounds of reccled plastic and another five hundred forty seven million pounds of reclaimed wood that said asek is committed to catching up to its rival within the last year it completed a life cycle assessment and found that its composite and p v c products have lower total carbon footprints than sustainably harvested pine fifteen per cent lower for wood composite and five per cent for p v c in fiscal year twenty twenty asek used four hundred million pounds of recycled material to make its products mostly werpsyclo plastic with summercycled wood flower it wants to raise that to a billion pounds annually by the end of twenty twenty six it's important not to oversell the sustainability angle says eric perkins but if they look good last a long time and provide minimal worry they might continue their spread across the country"}
