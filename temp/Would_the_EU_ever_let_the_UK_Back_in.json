{"text": "this vidio is brought to you by brilliant as we h've detailed in previous vidios polling suggests that more and more voters think brexett was a mistake and a majority of brits now want another referendum on the issue the latest hugoo polling shows a record fifty six per cent of brits including twenty two per cent of brexeters think that brexet was a mistake while just thirty one per cent think that it was the right decision however at this moment in time no major u k party is advocating rejoining the e u at the next general election even labor which is supposed to be the more pro eu of the two main parties has ruled out rejoining the single market and customs union and the liberal democrats are only advocating rejoining the single market not the e u itself clearly there's little appetite for rejoining the e u amongst the u ks political class and in our previous vidio on the topic we've stressed that while there might be growing pro e u sentiment amongst the u k electorate the chances of the u k actually rejoining any time soon are pretty slim both because no mainstream party has it as a policy and because it's an open question as to whether the e u would even agree to it however michel barnier the former chief e u negotiator for brexet was recently interviewed on i t v's pesten t v show and he said that contrary to our apparent doom mongering the door is open and the u k could genuinely apply to rejoin any time so for this vidio we thought we'd take a look at what would happen if the u k did actually take barnier's advice and apply to rejoin and whether the e u would ever let the u k back in to the blockbefore we start if you haven't already please consider subscribing and ringing the bell to stay in the loop and be notified when we release new vidios so let's get straight into it would the e u let the u k back in well from the e us perspective there are a couple of arguments for and against the u k rejoining let's first take a look at the arguments against first the u k rejoining would be an obstacle to further e u political integration when the u k was a member of the e u many inside the eu particularly the french saw the u k as a hindrance to the idea of political integration as a member the u k preferred widening expansion of the e u to include eastern europe over deepening just focusing on single currency shengon et cetera the u k also loved its optouts and never joined the shengen area or the uro some analists even believe that the corona viris balout where member states agreed to jointly borrow seven hundred and fifteen billion uros to respond to the pandemic would never have been agreed to if the u k were still a member many inside the e u believe it needs to change first before it accepts any one new and the u k size and general wariness of further integration would hinder that project second it could become another unwonted trouble maker this might sound obvious but the e u would need to be very convinced that brexotism has been completely purged from the u k body politic before it would even open talk for example they would not welcome a membership application from a potential starma government if the conservative opposition remained opposed to the e u that's because there would be a danger of britan joining and leaving every few years there needs to be a stable sustained and unambiguous commitment in the u k to membership as there's no appetite from the e u side to reintroduce a troublesome member state now let's take a look at the major reasons why the e u would allow the u k back in let's assume the u k is fully committed to the e u cause what have they got to gain well several things first and most obviously the u k would be one of the largest economies in the e u a net contributor to the e u budget and great news for the single market second the u k has one of the largest militaries in europe and its presence could go some way to help the e u develop a feasible defense policy third if the u k were to rejoin it would be possibly the best advert there is for e u membership and would help prevent further anti e u sentiment inside the e u a country that democratically decides to leave but then changes its mind and democratically decides to rejoin would demonstrate to the rest of the e u members if it hasn't done so already that going alone is very difficult in to day's globalized and interconnected world so assuming that both sides were keen what would the u k actually have to do to rejoin first the conditions assuming the uk didn't get any special treatment it would need to prove that it can meet what's called the copenhagen criteria which consists of the following political so e u values sound institutions and robust checks and balances economic so are functioning and resilient market economy administrative and institutional so that's the capacity to implement and absorb the full sum of e u law given it used to be a member the u k would almost definitely satisfy these criteria but it runs into more trouble with the uro and the shengen area which are both requirements for new member states even if they didn't ask for all the previous optouts it's hard to imagine the u k giving up any border controls for shengen or the pound for the uro and any u k government that applied to rejoin would almost definitely try to carve out exemptions here which could scupper their application now technically there's no specific time limit for these measures and they can be phased in later if at all once the u k becomes a member for example cyprus romania and bulgaria have yet to join the shengen area but technically are legally obligated to and seven countries bulgaria the check republic denmark hungary poland romania and sweden are e u members but do not use the uro however the e u would probably want guarantees that the u k wasn't going to do this not least because it would make further e u integration significantly more difficult whatever compromises the two sides and up agreeing to it's hard to see it getting unanimous support from the e u as would be required it's hard for example to imagine mccran agreeing to anything apart from full fledged membership for the u k given his aspirations for deeper political integration within the e u so that's what it would actually require for the u k to join the e u while it's technically and legally possible the political barriers here mean it's unlikely to happen any time soon as generous as barnier's offer might have been having just watched an eight minute vidio
